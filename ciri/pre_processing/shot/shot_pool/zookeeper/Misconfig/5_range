Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for ZooKeeper version 3.7.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["tickTime"],
    "reason": ["The property 'tickTime' has the value '3000000000' which exceeds the range of an Integer."]
}
```
