<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edits.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir1</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the transaction (edits) file. If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the transaction file is replicated in all of the 
      directories, for redundancy. Default value is same as dfs.namenode.name.dir
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes</name>
  <value>100</value>
  <description>
    The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.metrics.logger.period.seconds</name>
  <value>300</value>
  <description>
    This setting controls how frequently the DataNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    DataNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    DataNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.enable.retrycache</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    This enables the retry cache on the namenode. Namenode tracks for
    non-idempotent requests the corresponding response. If a client retries the
    request, the response from the retry cache is sent. Such operations
    are tagged with annotation @AtMostOnce in namenode protocols. It is
    recommended that this flag be set to true. Setting it to false, will result
    in clients getting failure responses to retried request. This flag must 
    be enabled in HA setup for transparent fail-overs.

    The entries in the cache have expiration time configurable
    using dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>
    The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.context</name>
  <value>default</value>
  <description>
    The name of the DFSClient context that we should use.  Clients that share
    a context share a socket cache and short-circuit cache, among other things.
    You should only change this if you don't want to share with another set of
    threads.

<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.browser-useragents-regex</name>
  <value>^Mozilla.*</value>
  <description>
    A comma-separated list of regular expressions used to match against an HTTP
    request's User-Agent header when protection against cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting
    dfs.webhdfs.reset-csrf.enabled to true.  If the incoming User-Agent matches
    any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent
    by a browser, and therefore CSRF prevention is enforced.  If the request's
    User-Agent does not match any of these regular expressions, then the request
    is considered to be sent by something other than a browser, such as scripted
    automation.  In this case, CSRF is not a potential attack vector, so
    the prevention is not enforced.  This helps achieve backwards-compatibility
    with existing automation that has not been updated to send the CSRF
    prevention header.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-threshold</name>
  <value>128</value>
  <description>
    The count threshold for each array length so that a manager is created only after the
    allocation count exceeds the threshold. In other words, the particular array length
    is not managed until the allocation count exceeds the threshold.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HDFS version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
