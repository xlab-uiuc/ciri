<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.http.internal-proxy.port</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    The datanode's internal web proxy port.
    By default it selects a random port available in runtime.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
  <description>
    The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS) which a DataNode
    should use to determine its own host name.

    Prefer using hadoop.security.dns.nameserver over
    dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.secondary.namenode.kerberos.internal.spnego.principal</name>
  <value>${dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal}</value>
  <description>
    The server principal used by the Secondary NameNode for web UI SPNEGO
    authentication when Kerberos security is enabled. Like all other
    Secondary NameNode settings, it is ignored in an HA setup.

    If the value is '*', the web server will attempt to login with
    every principal specified in the keytab file
    dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.keytab.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>nfs.allow.insecure.ports</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    When set to false, client connections originating from unprivileged ports
    (those above 1023) will be rejected. This is to ensure that clients
    connecting to this NFS Gateway must have had root privilege on the machine
    where they're connecting from.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.reject-unresolved-dn-topology-mapping</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    If the value is set to true, then namenode will reject datanode 
    registration if the topology mapping for a datanode is not resolved and 
    NULL is returned (script defined by net.topology.script.file.name fails 
    to execute). Otherwise, datanode will be registered and the default rack 
    will be assigned as the topology path. Topology paths are important for 
    data resiliency, since they define fault domains. Thus it may be unwanted 
    behavior to allow datanode registration with the default rack if the 
    resolving topology failed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.lock.fair</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>If this is true, the Datanode FsDataset lock will be used in Fair
    mode, which will help to prevent writer threads from being starved, but can
    lower lock throughput. See java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock
    for more information on fair/non-fair locks.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.custom-header</name>
  <value>X-XSRF-HEADER</value>
  <description>
    The name of a custom header that HTTP requests must send when protection
    against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting
    dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.enabled to true.  The WebHDFS client also uses this
    property to determine whether or not it needs to send the custom CSRF
    prevention header in its HTTP requests.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HDFS version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
