<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.safemode.extension</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.outliers.report.interval</name>
  <value>60m</value>
  <description>
    This setting controls how frequently DataNodes will report their peer
    latencies to the NameNode via heartbeats.  This setting supports
    multiple time unit suffixes as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
    If no suffix is specified then milliseconds is assumed.

    It is ignored if dfs.datanode.peer.stats.enabled is false.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.mmap.cache.size</name>
  <value>512</value>
  <description>
    When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0.

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.zkfc.port</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>
    The port number that the zookeeper failover controller RPC
    server binds to.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.retry.max.attempts</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>
    Max retry to satisfy the block storage policy. After this retry block will be removed
    from the movement needed queue.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.provided.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      Enables the Namenode to handle provided storages.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.provided.aliasmap.text.write.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
    <description>
        The path to which the provided block map should be written as a text
        file, specified as a URI.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.provided.acls.import.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      Set to true to inherit ACLs (Access Control Lists) from remote stores
      during mount. Disabled by default, i.e., ACLs are not inherited from
      remote stores. Note had HDFS ACLs have to be enabled
      (dfs.namenode.acls.enabled must be set to true) for this to take effect.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HDFS version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["dfs.ha.zkfc.port"],
    "reason": ["The property 'dfs.ha.zkfc.port' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range of a port number."]
}
```
