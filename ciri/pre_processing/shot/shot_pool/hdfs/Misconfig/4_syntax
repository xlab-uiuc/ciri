<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:9866</value>
  <description>
    The datanode server address and port for data transfer.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.https.keystore.resource</name>
  <value>ssl-client.xml</value>
  <description>Resource file from which ssl client keystore
  information will be extracted
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>file:/</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
      directories, for redundancy. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.tail-edits.rolledits.timeout</name>
  <value>30</value>
  <description>The timeout in seconds of calling rollEdits RPC on Active NN.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec</name>
  <value>5000</value>
  <description>
    Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.multiplier.threshold</name>
  <value>0.25</value>
  <description>
    Determines when an active namenode will roll its own edit log.
    The actual threshold (in number of edits) is determined by multiplying
    this value by dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns.

    This prevents extremely large edit files from accumulating on the active
    namenode, which can cause timeouts during namenode startup and pose an
    administrative hassle. This behavior is intended as a failsafe for when
    the standby or secondary namenode fail to roll the edit log by the normal
    checkpoint threshold.

<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.custom-header</name>
  <value>X-XSRF-HEADER</value>
  <description>
    The name of a custom header that HTTP requests must send when protection
    against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting
    dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.enabled to true.  The WebHDFS client also uses this
    property to determine whether or not it needs to send the custom CSRF
    prevention header in its HTTP requests.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.batched.ls.limit</name>
  <value>200</value>
  <description>
    Limit the number of paths that can be listed in a single batched
    listing call. printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HDFS version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["dfs.namenode.name.dir"],
    "reason": ["The property 'dfs.namenode.name.dir' has the value 'file:/' which does not follow the correct URL format."]
}
```
