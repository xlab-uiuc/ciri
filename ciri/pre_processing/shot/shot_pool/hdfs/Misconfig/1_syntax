<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad.factor</name>
  <value>ciri</value>
    <description>The factor by which a node's load can exceed the average
      before being rejected for writes, only if considerLoad is true.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.failover.max.attempts</name>
  <value>30</value>
  <description>
    Expert only. The number of client failover attempts that should be
    made before the failover is considered failed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold</name>
  <value>21474836480</value>
  <description>
    Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.multiplier.threshold</name>
  <value>1.0</value>
  <description>
    Determines when an active namenode will roll its own edit log.
    The actual threshold (in number of edits) is determined by multiplying
    this value by dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns.

    This prevents extremely large edit files from accumulating on the active
    namenode, which can cause timeouts during namenode startup and pose an
    administrative hassle. This behavior is intended as a failsafe for when
    the standby or secondary namenode fail to roll the edit log by the normal
    checkpoint threshold.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.lock.fair</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>If this is true, the Datanode FsDataset lock will be used in Fair
    mode, which will help to prevent writer threads from being starved, but can
    lower lock throughput. See java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock
    for more information on fair/non-fair locks.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>20000</value>
  <description>
    The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC
    tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes
    SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY.
    If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.journalnode.sync.interval</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    Time interval, in milliseconds, between two Journal Node syncs.
    This configuration takes effect only if the journalnode sync is enabled
    by setting the configuration parameter dfs.journalnode.enable.sync to true.
  </description>

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HDFS version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad.factor"],
    "reason": ["The property 'dfs.namenode.redundancy.considerLoad.factor' has the value 'ciri' which is not of the correct type Integer."]
}
```
