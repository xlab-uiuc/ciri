Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for etcd version 3.5.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["strict-reconfig-check"],
    "reason": ["The property 'strict-reconfig-check' has the value '-1' which is not within the accepted value {true,false}."]
}
```
