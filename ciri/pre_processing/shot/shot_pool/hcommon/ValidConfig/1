<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.groups.shell.command.timeout</name>
  <value>2s</value>
  <description>
    Used by the ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping class, this property controls how
    long to wait for the underlying shell command that is run to fetch groups.
    Expressed in seconds (e.g. 10s, 1m, etc.), if the running command takes
    longer than the value configured, the command is aborted and the groups
    resolver would return a result of no groups found. A value of 0s (default)
    would mean an infinite wait (i.e. wait until the command exits on its own).

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.providers.combined</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    true or false to indicate whether groups from the providers are combined or
    not. The default value is true. If true, then all the providers will be
    tried to get groups and all the groups are combined to return as the final
    results. Otherwise, providers are tried one by one in the configured list
    order, and if any groups are retrieved from any provider, then the groups
    will be returned without trying the left ones.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.committer.staging.abort.pending.uploads</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Should the staging committers abort all pending uploads to the destination
    directory?

    Changing this if more than one partitioned committer is
    writing to the same destination tree simultaneously; otherwise
    the first job to complete will cancel all outstanding uploads from the
    others. However, it may lead to leaked outstanding uploads from failed
    tasks. If disabled, configure the bucket lifecycle to remove uploads
    after a time period, and/or set up a workflow to explicitly delete
    entries. Otherwise there is a risk that uncommitted uploads may run up
    bills.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HCommon version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
