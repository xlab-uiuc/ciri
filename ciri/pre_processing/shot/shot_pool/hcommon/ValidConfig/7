<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.before.failover</name>
  <value>6</value>
  <description>
    This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations
    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.retry.throttle.interval</name>
  <value>100ms</value>
  <description>
    Initial between retry attempts on throttled requests, +/- 50%. chosen at random.
    i.e. for an intial value of 3000ms, the initial delay would be in the range 1500ms to 4500ms.
    Backoffs are exponential; again randomness is used to avoid the thundering heard problem.
    500ms is the default value used by the AWS S3 Retry policy.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.committer.staging.conflict-mode</name>
  <value>append</value>
  <description>
    Staging committer conflict resolution policy.
    Supported: "fail", "append", "replace".
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>
    Time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service; 0 means no timeout.
    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
    converged to Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.change.detection.source</name>
  <value>etag</value>
  <description>
    Select which S3 object attribute to use for change detection.
    Currently support 'etag' for S3 object eTags and 'versionid' for
    S3 object version IDs.  Use of version IDs requires object versioning to be
    enabled for each S3 bucket utilized.  Object versioning is disabled on
    buckets by default. When version ID is used, the buckets utilized should
    have versioning enabled before any data is written.

    For hdfs clients, the provider path will be same as namenode's
    provider path.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HCommon version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
