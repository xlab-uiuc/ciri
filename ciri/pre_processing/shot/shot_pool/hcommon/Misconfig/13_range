<property>
  <name>hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout</name>
  <value>30s</value>
    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.committer.staging.tmp.path</name>
  <value>/valid/file1</value>
  <description>
    Path in the cluster filesystem for temporary data.
    This is for HDFS, not the local filesystem.
    It is only for the summary data of each file, not the actual
    data being committed.
    Using an unqualified path guarantees that the full path will be
    generated relative to the home directory of the user creating the job,
    hence private (assuming home directory permissions are secure).

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.change.detection.mode</name>
  <value>server</value>
  <description>
    Determines how change detection is applied to alert to inconsistent S3
    objects read during or after an overwrite. Value 'server' indicates to apply
    the attribute constraint directly on GetObject requests to S3. Value 'client'
    means to do a client-side comparison of the attribute value returned in the
    response.  Value 'server' would not work with third-party S3 implementations
    that do not support these constraints on GetObject. Values 'server' and
    'client' generate RemoteObjectChangedException when a mismatch is detected.
    Value 'warn' works like 'client' but generates only a warning.  Value 'none'
    will ignore change detection completely.

<property>
  <name>ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockshared</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds a shared (read) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider.

<property>
  <name>fs.permissions.umask-mode</name>
  <value>888</value>
  <description>
    The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    "022" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or "u=rwx,g=rwx,o=" (symbolic for 007 in octal).

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.low-watermark</name>
  <value>0.15</value>
  <description>
    If size of the EncryptedKeyVersion cache Queue falls below the
    low watermark, this cache queue will be scheduled for a refill

<property>
  <name>seq.io.sort.factor</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>
      The number of streams to merge at once while sorting
      files using SequenceFile.Sorter.
      This determines the number of open file handles.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HCommon version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["fs.permissions.umask-mode"],
    "reason": ["The property 'fs.permissions.umask-mode' has the value '888' which is out of the valid range of a permission number."]
}
```
