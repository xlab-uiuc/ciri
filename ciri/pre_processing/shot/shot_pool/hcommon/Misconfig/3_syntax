<property>
  <name>hadoop.tmp.dir</name>
  <value>/tmp//hadoop-ciri</value>
  <description>A base for other temporary directories.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>io.file.buffer.size</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.security.credential.provider.path</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
  <description>
    Optional comma separated list of credential providers, a list
    which is prepended to that set in hadoop.security.credential.provider.path
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.executor.capacity</name>
  <value>16</value>
  <description>The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in "fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks"

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in "fs.s3a.threads.max"; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.retry.throttle.limit</name>
  <value>10</value>

<property>
  <name>ftp.stream-buffer-size</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.kms.client.timeout</name>

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HCommon version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["hadoop.tmp.dir"],
    "reason": ["The property 'hadoop.tmp.dir' has the value '/tmp//hadoop-ciri' which does not follow the correct path format."]
}
```
