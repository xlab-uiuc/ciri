<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.groups.shell.command.timeout</name>
  <value>0s</value>
  <description>
    Used by the ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping class, this property controls how
    long to wait for the underlying shell command that is run to fetch groups.
    Expressed in seconds (e.g. 10s, 1m, etc.), if the running command takes
    longer than the value configured, the command is aborted and the groups
    resolver would return a result of no groups found. A value of 0s (default)
    would mean an infinite wait (i.e. wait until the command exits on its own).

<property>
  <name>hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout</name>
  <value>30s</value>
    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".

<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>file:/</value>
  <description>The name of the default file system.  A URI whose
  scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation.  The
  uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming
  the FileSystem implementation class.  The uri's authority is used to
  determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.default.name</name>
  <value>file:///</value>
  <description>Deprecated. Use (fs.defaultFS) property
  instead</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.metadatastore.metadata.ttl</name>
  <value>1m</value>
    <description>
        This value sets how long an entry in a MetadataStore is valid.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.table.sse.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Whether server-side encryption (SSE) is enabled or disabled on the table.
    By default it's disabled, meaning SSE is set to AWS owned CMK.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.util.hash.type</name>
  <value>murmur</value>
  <description>The default implementation of Hash. Currently this can take one of the
  two values: 'murmur' to select MurmurHash and 'jenkins' to select JenkinsHash.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.metrics.jvm.use-thread-mxbean</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>
      Whether or not ThreadMXBean is used for getting thread info in JvmMetrics,
      ThreadGroup approach is preferred for better performance.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HCommon version 3.3.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["fs.defaultFS"],
    "reason": ["The property 'fs.defaultFS' has the value 'file:/' which does not follow the correct URL format."]
}
```
