Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for Redis version 7.0.0? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["replica-announce-ip"],
    "reason": ["The property 'replica-announce-ip' has the value '256.0.0.0' which is out of the valid range of an IP address."]
}
```
