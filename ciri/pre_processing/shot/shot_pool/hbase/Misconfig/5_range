<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.scan.ratio</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>Given the number of read call queues, calculated from the total number
      of call queues multiplied by the callqueue.read.ratio, the scan.ratio property
      will split the read call queues into small-read and long-read queues.
      A value lower than 0.5 means that there will be less long-read queues than short-read queues.
      A value of 0.5 means that there will be the same number of short-read and long-read queues.
      A value greater than 0.5 means that there will be more long-read queues than short-read queues
      A value of 0 or 1 indicate to use the same set of queues for gets and scans.

      Example: Given the total number of read call queues being 8
      a scan.ratio of 0 or 1 means that: 8 queues will contain both long and short read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.3 means that: 2 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 6 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.5 means that: 4 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 4 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.8 means that: 6 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 2 queues will contain only short-read requests.

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.msginterval</name>
  <value>3000000000</value>
    <description>Interval between messages from the RegionServer to Master
    in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>zookeeper.session.timeout</name>
  <value>180000</value>
    <description>ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. It is used in two different ways.
      First, this value is used in the ZK client that HBase uses to connect to the ensemble.
      It is also used by HBase when it starts a ZK server and it is passed as the 'maxSessionTimeout'.
      See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions.
      For example, if an HBase region server connects to a ZK ensemble that's also managed
      by HBase, then the session timeout will be the one specified by this configuration.
      But, a region server that connects to an ensemble managed with a different configuration
      will be subjected that ensemble's maxSessionTimeout. So, even though HBase might propose
      using 90 seconds, the ensemble can have a max timeout lower than this and it will take
      precedence. The current default maxSessionTimeout that ZK ships with is 40 seconds, which is lower than
      HBase's.

<property>
  <name>hfile.block.cache.size</name>
  <value>0.2</value>
    <description>Percentage of maximum heap (-Xmx setting) to allocate to block cache
        used by a StoreFile. Default of 0.4 means allocate 40%.
        Set to 0 to disable but it's not recommended; you need at least
        enough cache to hold the storefile indices.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.threads.max</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid OOM issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.loadbalance.bytable</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Factor Table name when the balancer runs.
      Default: false.

</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.security.visibility.mutations.checkauths</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      This property if enabled, will check whether the labels in the visibility
      expression are associated with the user issuing the mutation

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.master.timeout.millis</name>
  <value>300000</value>
    <description>
       Timeout for master for the snapshot procedure execution.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["hbase.regionserver.msginterval"],
    "reason": ["The property 'hbase.regionserver.msginterval' has the value '3000000000' which exceeds the range of an Integer."]
}
```
