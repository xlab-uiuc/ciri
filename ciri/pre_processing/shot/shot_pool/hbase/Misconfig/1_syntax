<property>
  <name>hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout</name>
  <value>ciri</value>
    <description>Splitting a region, how long to wait on the file-splitting
      step before aborting the attempt. Default: 600000. This setting used
      to be known as hbase.regionserver.fileSplitTimeout in hbase-1.x.
      Split is now run master-side hence the rename (If a
      'hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout' setting found, will use it to
      prime the current 'hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout'
      Configuration.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hfile.index.block.max.size</name>
  <value>262144</value>
      <description>When the size of a leaf-level, intermediate-level, or root-level
          index block in a multi-level block index grows to this size, the
          block is written out and a new block is started.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rs.cacheblocksonwrite</name>
  <value>true</value>
      <description>Whether an HFile block should be added to the block cache when the
        block is finished.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.hostname</name>
  <value>127.0.0.1</value>
    <description>This config is for experts: don't set its value unless you really know what you are doing.
    When set to a non-empty value, this represents the (external facing) hostname for the underlying server.
    See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12954 for details.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>Use Thrift TFramedTransport on the server side.
      This is the recommended transport for thrift servers and requires a similar setting
      on the client side. Changing this to false will select the default transport,
      vulnerable to DoS when malformed requests are issued due to THRIFT-601.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.working.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
    <description>Location where the snapshotting process will occur. The location of the
      completed snapshots will not change, but the temporary directory where the snapshot
      process occurs will be set to this location. This can be a separate filesystem than
      the root directory, for performance increase purposes. See HBASE-21098 for more
      information</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.replication.source.maxthreads</name>
  <value>1</value>
    <description>
        The maximum number of threads any replication source will use for
        shipping edits to the sinks in parallel. This also limits the number of
        chunks each replication batch is broken into. Larger values can improve
        the replication throughput between the master and slave clusters. The
        default of 10 will rarely need to be changed.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold</name>
  <value>5000</value>
    <description>
      Number of rows in a batch operation above which a warning will be logged.
    </description>

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout"],
    "reason": ["The property 'hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout' has the value 'ciri' which is not of the correct type Integer."]
}
```
