<property>
  <name>hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound.min</name>
  <value>16777216</value>
    <description>
    If FlushLargeStoresPolicy is used and there are multiple column families,
    then every time that we hit the total memstore limit, we find out all the
    column families whose memstores exceed a "lower bound" and only flush them
    while retaining the others in memory. The "lower bound" will be
    "hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size / column_family_number" by default
    unless value of this property is larger than that. If none of the families
    have their memstore size more than lower bound, all the memstores will be
    flushed (just as usual).

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.min</name>
  <value>12</value>
    <description>The minimum number of StoreFiles which must be eligible for compaction before
      compaction can run. The goal of tuning hbase.hstore.compaction.min is to avoid ending up with
      too many tiny StoreFiles to compact. Setting this value to 2 would cause a minor compaction
      each time you have two StoreFiles in a Store, and this is probably not appropriate. If you
      set this value too high, all the other values will need to be adjusted accordingly. For most
      cases, the default value is appropriate  (empty value here, results in 3 by code logic). In 
      previous versions of HBase, the parameter hbase.hstore.compaction.min was named 
      hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.max</name>
  <value>10</value>
    <description>The maximum number of StoreFiles which will be selected for a single minor
      compaction, regardless of the number of eligible StoreFiles. Effectively, the value of
      hbase.hstore.compaction.max controls the length of time it takes a single compaction to
      complete. Setting it larger means that more StoreFiles are included in a compaction. For most
      cases, the default value is appropriate.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.offpeak.start.hour</name>
  <value>-2</value>
    <description>The start of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.
      Set to -1 to disable off-peak.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rs.cacheblocksonwrite</name>
  <value>false</value>
      <description>Whether an HFile block should be added to the block cache when the
        block is finished.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.domain.socket.path</name>
  <value>/valid/file1</value>
    <description>
      This is a path to a UNIX domain socket that will be used for
      communication between the DataNode and local HDFS clients, if
      dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is set to true. If the string "_PORT" is
      present in this path, it will be replaced by the TCP port of the DataNode.
      Be careful about permissions for the directory that hosts the shared
      domain socket; dfsclient will complain if open to other users than the HBase user.

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.csrf.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Set to true to enable protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>
      The period (in milliseconds) for refreshing the store files for the secondary regions. 0
      means this feature is disabled. Secondary regions sees new files (from flushes and
      compactions) from primary once the secondary region refreshes the list of files in the
      region (there is no notification mechanism). But too frequent refreshes might cause
      extra Namenode pressure. If the files cannot be refreshed for longer than HFile TTL
      (hbase.master.hfilecleaner.ttl) the requests are rejected. Configuring HFile TTL to a larger
      value is also recommended with this setting.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["hbase.hstore.compaction.max"],
    "reason": ["The value of the property 'hbase.hstore.compaction.min' should be smaller or equal to the value of the property 'hbase.hstore.compaction.max'."]
}
```
