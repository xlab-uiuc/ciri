<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.handler.count</name>
  <value>30</value>
    <description>Count of RPC Listener instances spun up on RegionServers.
      Same property is used by the Master for count of master handlers.
      Too many handlers can be counter-productive. Make it a multiple of
      CPU count. If mostly read-only, handlers count close to cpu count
      does well. Start with twice the CPU count and tune from there.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.logroll.period</name>
  <value>3600000</value>
    <description>Period at which we will roll the commit log regardless
    of how many edits it has.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.hlog.writer.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.ProtobufLogWriter</value>
    <description>The WAL file writer implementation.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.peerport</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other.
    See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_RunningReplicatedZooKeeper
    for more information.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier</name>
  <value>8</value>
    <description>
    Block updates if memstore has hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier
    times hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size bytes.  Useful preventing
    runaway memstore during spikes in update traffic.  Without an
    upper-bound, memstore fills such that when it flushes the
    resultant flush files take a long time to compact or split, or
    worse, we OOME.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.offpeak.end.hour</name>
  <value>0</value>
    <description>The end of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive. Set
      to -1 to disable off-peak.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.threads.max</name>
  <value>100</value>
    <description>The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid OOM issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.status.publisher.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.ClusterStatusPublisher$MulticastPublisher</value>
    <description>
      Implementation of the status publication with a multicast message.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": true,
    "errParameter": ["hbase.zookeeper.peerport"],
    "reason": ["The property 'hbase.zookeeper.peerport' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range of a port number."]
}
```
