<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.dns.interface</name>
  <value>default</value>
    <description>The name of the Network Interface from which a region server
      should report its IP address.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.retries.number</name>
  <value>15</value>
    <description>Maximum retries.  Used as maximum for all retryable
    operations such as the getting of a cell's value, starting a row update,
    etc.  Retry interval is a rough function based on hbase.client.pause.  At
    first we retry at this interval but then with backoff, we pretty quickly reach
    retrying every ten seconds.  See HConstants#RETRY_BACKOFF for how the backup
    ramps up.  Change this setting and hbase.client.pause to suit your workload.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle</name>
  <value>1342177280</value>
    <description>There are two different thread pools for compactions, one for large compactions and
      the other for small compactions. This helps to keep compaction of lean tables (such as
      hbase:meta) fast. If a compaction is larger than this threshold, it
      goes into the large compaction pool. In most cases, the default value is appropriate. Default:
      2 x hbase.hstore.compaction.max x hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size (which defaults to 128MB).
      The value field assumes that the value of hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size is unchanged from
      the default.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.kv.max</name>
  <value>10</value>
    <description>The maximum number of KeyValues to read and then write in a batch when flushing or
      compacting. Set this lower if you have big KeyValues and problems with Out Of Memory
      Exceptions Set this higher if you have wide, small rows. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hfile.block.cache.size</name>
  <value>0.8</value>
    <description>Percentage of maximum heap (-Xmx setting) to allocate to block cache
        used by a StoreFile. Default of 0.4 means allocate 40%.
        Set to 0 to disable but it's not recommended; you need at least
        enough cache to hold the storefile indices.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>Enables or disables coprocessor loading. If 'false'
    (disabled), any other coprocessor related configuration will be ignored.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.table.max.rowsize</name>
  <value>2147483648</value>
    <description>
      Maximum size of single row in bytes (default is 1 Gb) for Get'ting
      or Scan'ning without in-row scan flag set. If row size exceeds this limit
      RowTooBigException is thrown to client.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period</name>
  <value>43200</value>
    <description>
      The period that ExpiredMobFileCleanerChore runs. The unit is second.
      The default value is one day. The MOB file name uses only the date part of
      the file creation time in it. We use this time for deciding TTL expiry of
      the files. So the removal of TTL expired files might be delayed. The max
      delay might be 24 hrs.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
