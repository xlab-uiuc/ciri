<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.scan.ratio</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>Given the number of read call queues, calculated from the total number
      of call queues multiplied by the callqueue.read.ratio, the scan.ratio property
      will split the read call queues into small-read and long-read queues.
      A value lower than 0.5 means that there will be less long-read queues than short-read queues.
      A value of 0.5 means that there will be the same number of short-read and long-read queues.
      A value greater than 0.5 means that there will be more long-read queues than short-read queues
      A value of 0 or 1 indicate to use the same set of queues for gets and scans.

      Example: Given the total number of read call queues being 8
      a scan.ratio of 0 or 1 means that: 8 queues will contain both long and short read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.3 means that: 2 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 6 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.5 means that: 4 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 4 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.8 means that: 6 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 2 queues will contain only short-read requests.

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.operation.timeout</name>
  <value>2400000</value>
    <description>Operation timeout is a top-level restriction (millisecond) that makes sure a
      blocking operation in Table will not be blocked more than this. In each operation, if rpc
      request fails because of timeout or other reason, it will retry until success or throw
      RetriesExhaustedException. But if the total time being blocking reach the operation timeout
      before retries exhausted, it will break early and throw SocketTimeoutException.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.superuser</name>
  <value>xdsuper</value>
    <description>List of users or groups (comma-separated), who are allowed
    full privileges, regardless of stored ACLs, across the cluster.
    Only used when HBase security is enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.fallback-to-simple-auth-allowed</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>When a server is configured to require secure connections, it will
      reject connection attempts from clients using SASL SIMPLE (unsecure) authentication.
      This setting allows secure servers to accept SASL SIMPLE connections from clients
      when the client requests.  When false (the default), the server will not allow the fallback
      to SIMPLE authentication, and will reject the connection.  WARNING: This setting should ONLY
      be used as a temporary measure while converting clients over to secure authentication.  It
      MUST BE DISABLED for secure operation.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.support.proxyuser</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Enables running the REST server to support proxy-user mode.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.checksum.algorithm</name>
  <value>CRC32C</value>
    <description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.dynamic.jars.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
    <description>
      The directory from which the custom filter JARs can be loaded
      dynamically by the region server without the need to restart. However,
      an already loaded filter/co-processor class would not be un-loaded. See
      HBASE-1936 for more details.

      Does not apply to coprocessors.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
