<property>
  <name>hbase.master.port</name>
  <value>3000</value>
    <description>The port the HBase Master should bind to.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.handler.count</name>
  <value>15</value>
    <description>Count of RPC Listener instances spun up on RegionServers.
      Same property is used by the Master for count of master handlers.
      Too many handlers can be counter-productive. Make it a multiple of
      CPU count. If mostly read-only, handlers count close to cpu count
      does well. Start with twice the CPU count and tune from there.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.keyvalue.maxsize</name>
  <value>20971520</value>
    <description>Specifies the combined maximum allowed size of a KeyValue
    instance. This is to set an upper boundary for a single entry saved in a
    storage file. Since they cannot be split it helps avoiding that a region
    cannot be split any further because the data is too large. It seems wise
    to set this to a fraction of the maximum region size. Setting it to zero
    or less disables the check.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period</name>
  <value>120000</value>
    <description>Client scanner lease period in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.threads.max</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid OOM issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.region.replica.replication.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>
      Whether asynchronous WAL replication to the secondary region replicas is enabled or not.
      If this is enabled, a replication peer named "region_replica_replication" will be created
      which will tail the logs and replicate the mutations to region replicas for tables that
      have region replication > 1. If this is enabled once, disabling this replication also
      requires disabling the replication peer using shell or Admin java class.
      Replication to secondary region replicas works over standard inter-cluster replication.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.delfile.max.count</name>
  <value>3</value>
    <description>
      The max number of del files that is allowed in the mob compaction.
      In the mob compaction, when the number of existing del files is larger than
      this value, they are merged until number of del files is not larger this value.
      The default value is 3.

</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold</name>
  <value>5000</value>
    <description>
      Number of rows in a batch operation above which a warning will be logged.
    </description>

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
