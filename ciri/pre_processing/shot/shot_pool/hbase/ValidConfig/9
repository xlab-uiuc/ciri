<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
    <description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
      which a ZooKeeper server should use to determine the host name used by the
      master for communication and display purposes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.maxClientCnxns</name>
  <value>300</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    Limit on number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a
    single client, identified by IP address, may make to a single member of
    the ZooKeeper ensemble. Set high to avoid zk connection issues running
    standalone and pseudo-distributed.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold</name>
  <value>6</value>
    <description> If more than this number of StoreFiles exist in any one Store
      (one StoreFile is written per flush of MemStore), a compaction is run to rewrite all
      StoreFiles into a single StoreFile. Larger values delay compaction, but when compaction does
      occur, it takes longer to complete.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles</name>
  <value>16</value>
    <description> If more than this number of StoreFiles exist in any one Store (one StoreFile
     is written per flush of MemStore), updates are blocked for this region until a compaction is
      completed, or until hbase.hstore.blockingWaitTime has been exceeded.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.status.multicast.address.port</name>
  <value>16100</value>
    <description>
      Multicast port to use for the status publication by multicast.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.security.exec.permission.checks</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      If this setting is enabled and ACL based access control is active (the
      AccessController coprocessor is installed either as a system coprocessor
      or on a table as a table coprocessor) then you must grant all relevant
      users EXEC privilege if they require the ability to execute coprocessor
      endpoint calls. EXEC privilege, like any other permission, can be
      granted globally to a user, or to a user on a per table or per namespace
      basis. For more information on coprocessor endpoints, see the coprocessor
      section of the HBase online manual. For more information on granting or
      revoking permissions using the AccessController, see the security
      section of the HBase online manual.

<property>
  <name>hbase.coordinated.state.manager.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coordination.ZkCoordinatedStateManager</value>
    <description>Fully qualified name of class implementing coordinated state manager.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.replication.source.maxthreads</name>
  <value>1</value>
    <description>
        The maximum number of threads any replication source will use for
        shipping edits to the sinks in parallel. This also limits the number of
        chunks each replication batch is broken into. Larger values can improve
        the replication throughput between the master and slave clusters. The
        default of 10 will rarely need to be changed.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
