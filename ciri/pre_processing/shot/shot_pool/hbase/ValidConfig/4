<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.hlog.reader.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.ProtobufLogReader</value>
    <description>The WAL file reader implementation.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.keyvalue.maxsize</name>
  <value>10485760</value>
    <description>Specifies the combined maximum allowed size of a KeyValue
    instance. This is to set an upper boundary for a single entry saved in a
    storage file. Since they cannot be split it helps avoiding that a region
    cannot be split any further because the data is too large. It seems wise
    to set this to a fraction of the maximum region size. Setting it to zero
    or less disables the check.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound.min</name>
  <value>33554432</value>
    <description>
    If FlushLargeStoresPolicy is used and there are multiple column families,
    then every time that we hit the total memstore limit, we find out all the
    column families whose memstores exceed a "lower bound" and only flush them
    while retaining the others in memory. The "lower bound" will be
    "hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size / column_family_number" by default
    unless value of this property is larger than that. If none of the families
    have their memstore size more than lower bound, all the memstores will be
    flushed (just as usual).

</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.minorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by
      minor compactions. Setting it to true helps prevent minor compactions from
      polluting the page cache, which is most beneficial on clusters with low
      memory to storage ratio or very write heavy clusters. You may want to set it to
      false under moderate to low write workload when bulk of the reads are
      on the most recently written data.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hfile.block.index.cacheonwrite</name>
  <value>true</value>
      <description>This allows to put non-root multi-level index blocks into the block
          cache at the time the index is being written.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.column.max.version</name>
  <value>2</value>
    <description>New column family descriptors will use this value as the default number of versions
      to keep.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.bytes.per.checksum</name>
  <value>16384</value>
    <description>
        Number of bytes in a newly created checksum chunk for HBase-level
        checksums in hfile blocks.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.region.timeout</name>
  <value>600000</value>
    <description>
       Timeout for regionservers to keep threads in snapshot request pool waiting.

Question: Are there any mistakes in the above configuration file for HBase version 2.2.7? Respond in a json format similar to the following:
{
    "hasError": boolean, // true if there are errors, false if there are none
    "errParameter": [], // List containing properties with errors. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
    "reason": [] // List containing explanations for each error. If there are no errors, leave this as an empty array
}

Answer:
```json
{
    "hasError": false,
    "errParameter": [],
    "reason": []
}
```
