<property>
  <name>yarn.nodemanager.container-executor.exit-code-file.timeout-ms</name>
  <value>2000</value>
    <description>
      How long the container executor should wait for the exit code file to
      appear after a reacquired container has exited.

<property>
  <name>yarn.nodemanager.local-cache.max-files-per-directory</name>
  <value>16384</value>
    <description>It limits the maximum number of files which will be localized
      in a single local directory. If the limit is reached then sub-directories
      will be created and new files will be localized in them. If it is set to
      a value less than or equal to 36 [which are sub-directories (0-9 and then
      a-z)] then NodeManager will fail to start. For example; [for public
      cache] if this is configured with a value of 40 ( 4 files +
      36 sub-directories) and the local-dir is "/tmp/local-dir1" then it will
      allow 4 files to be created directly inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache".
      For files that are localized further it will create a sub-directory "0"
      inside "/tmp/local-dir1/filecache" and will localize files inside it
      until it becomes full. If a file is removed from a sub-directory that
      is marked full, then that sub-directory will be used back again to
      localize files.

<property>
  <name>yarn.log-aggregation-status.time-out.ms</name>
  <value>300000</value>
    <description>
    How long for ResourceManager to wait for NodeManager to report its
    log aggregation status. If waiting time of which the log aggregation
    status is reported from NodeManager exceeds the configured value, RM
    will report log aggregation status for this NodeManager as TIME_OUT.
    This configuration will be used in NodeManager as well to decide
    whether and when to delete the cached log aggregation status.

<property>
  <name>yarn.nodemanager.vmem-pmem-ratio</name>
  <value>4.2</value>
    <description>Ratio between virtual memory to physical memory when
    setting memory limits for containers. Container allocations are
    expressed in terms of physical memory, and virtual memory usage
    is allowed to exceed this allocation by this ratio.

    "yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.roll-monitoring-interval-seconds".
    If this configuration has been set less than its default value (3600)
    the NodeManager may raise a warning.
