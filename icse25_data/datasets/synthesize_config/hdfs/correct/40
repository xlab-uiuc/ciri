<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
      directories, for redundancy. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.replication.max</name>
  <value>1024</value>
  <description>Maximal block replication. 
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval</name>
  <value>21600s</value>
  <description>Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and
  reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.
  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.objects</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>The maximum number of files, directories and blocks
  dfs supports. A value of zero indicates no limit to the number
  of objects that dfs supports.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout</name>
  <value>1s</value>
  <description>
    Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive</name>
  <value>2000</value>
  <description>
    The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes</name>
  <value>2097152</value>
  <description>
    The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.snapshotdiff.listing.limit</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>
    Limit the number of entries generated by getSnapshotDiffReportListing within
    one rpc call to the namenode.If less or equal to zero, at most
    DFS_NAMENODE_SNAPSHOT_DIFF_LISTING_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be sent
    across to the client within one rpc call.
