<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-directory-items</name>
  <value>2097152</value>
  <description>Defines the maximum number of items that a directory may
      contain. Cannot set the property to a value less than 1 or more than
      6400000.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as "stale",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as "stale" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode).

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.block.map.allocation.percent</name>
  <value>0.5</value>
  <description>
    The percentage of the Java heap which we will allocate to the cached blocks
    map.  The cached blocks map is a hash map which uses chained hashing.
    Smaller maps may be accessed more slowly if the number of cached blocks is
    large; larger maps will consume more memory.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>1800000</value>
  <description>When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums.

<property>
  <name>dfs.balancer.address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:0</value>
  <description>
    The hostname used for a keytab based Kerberos login. Keytab based login
    can be enabled with dfs.balancer.keytab.enabled.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.restart.replica.expiration</name>
  <value>100</value>
  <description>
    During shutdown for restart, the amount of time in seconds budgeted for
    datanode restart.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.datanode.cache.refresh.interval.ms</name>
  <value>150000</value>
  <description>
    How often to refresh the datanode storages cache in milliseconds. This cache
    keeps live datanode storage reports fetched from namenode. After elapsed time,
    it will again fetch latest datanodes from namenode.
    By default, this parameter is set to 5 minutes.
