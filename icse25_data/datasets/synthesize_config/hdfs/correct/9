<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address</name>
  <value>127.0.0.1</value>
  <description>
    NameNode RPC lifeline address.  This is an optional separate RPC address
    that can be used to isolate health checks and liveness to protect against
    resource exhaustion in the main RPC handler pool.  In the case of
    HA/Federation where multiple NameNodes exist, the name service ID is added
    to the name e.g. dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address.ns1.  The value of this
    property will take the form of nn-host1:rpc-port.  If this property is not
    defined, then the NameNode will not start a lifeline RPC server.  By
    default, the property is not defined.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations</name>
  <value>4800</value>
  <description>When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached.

<property>
  <name>dfs.secondary.namenode.kerberos.internal.spnego.principal</name>
  <value>${dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.principal}</value>
  <description>
    The server principal used by the Secondary NameNode for web UI SPNEGO
    authentication when Kerberos security is enabled. Like all other
    Secondary NameNode settings, it is ignored in an HA setup.

    If the value is '*', the web server will attempt to login with
    every principal specified in the keytab file
    dfs.web.authentication.kerberos.keytab.

</property>

<property>
  <name>nfs.keytab.file</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
  <description>
    *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This is the path to the keytab file for the hdfs-nfs gateway.
    This is required when the cluster is kerberized.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms</name>
  <value>300</value>
  <description>The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds.

  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.BlockPlacementPolicyRackFaultTolerant</value>
  <description>
    Placement policy class for striped files.
    Defaults to BlockPlacementPolicyRackFaultTolerant.class
