<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
      directories, for redundancy. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>nfs.dump.dir</name>
  <value>/tmp/.hdfs-nfs</value>
  <description>
    This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before
    writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after
    they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory. 
    One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold</name>
  <value>5368709120</value>
  <description>
    Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms</name>
  <value>600000</value>
  <description>
    How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log,
    in milliseconds.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.reject-unresolved-dn-topology-mapping</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    If the value is set to true, then namenode will reject datanode 
    registration if the topology mapping for a datanode is not resolved and 
    NULL is returned (script defined by net.topology.script.file.name fails 
    to execute). Otherwise, datanode will be registered and the default rack 
    will be assigned as the topology path. Topology paths are important for 
    data resiliency, since they define fault domains. Thus it may be unwanted 
    behavior to allow datanode registration with the default rack if the 
    resolving topology failed.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.oob.timeout-ms</name>
  <value>[3000, 0, 0, 0]</value>
  <description>
    Timeout value when sending OOB response for each OOB type, which are
    OOB_RESTART, OOB_RESERVED1, OOB_RESERVED2, and OOB_RESERVED3,
    respectively.  Currently, only OOB_RESTART is used.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.interval.ms</name>
  <value>1200000</value>
  <description>
    The thread for checking the StorageInfo for defragmentation will
    run periodically.  The time between runs is determined by this
    property.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.interval</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>
    The interval after which the skip levels will be formed in the skip list
    for storing directory snapshot diffs. By default, value is set to 10.
