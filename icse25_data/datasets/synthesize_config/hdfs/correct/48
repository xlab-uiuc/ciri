<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases</name>
  <value>12</value>
  <description>The maximum number of leases for full block reports that the
    NameNode will issue at any given time.  This prevents the NameNode from
    being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler
    threads.  This number should never be more than the number of RPC handler
    threads or less than 1.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal.pattern</name>
  <value>*</value>
  <description>
    A client-side RegEx that can be configured to control
    allowed realms to authenticate with (useful in cross-realm env.)

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration</name>
  <value>4</value>
  <description>
    *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold</name>
  <value>5368709120</value>
  <description>
    Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize.

<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.methods-to-ignore</name>
  <value>OPTIONS</value>
  <description>
    A comma-separated list of HTTP methods that do not require HTTP requests to
    include a custom header when protection against cross-site request forgery
    (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.enabled to
    true.  The WebHDFS client also uses this property to determine whether or
    not it needs to send the custom CSRF prevention header in its HTTP requests.
