<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.https.address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:3000</value>
  <description>The datanode secure http server address and port.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.replication.min</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>Minimal block replication. 
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.log-roll.period</name>
  <value>120s</value>
  <description>
    How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.peer.metrics.min.outlier.detection.samples</name>
  <value>500</value>
    <description>
      Minimum number of packet send samples which are required to qualify for outlier detection.
      If the number of samples is below this then outlier detection is skipped.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms</name>
  <value>250</value>
  <description>How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have
    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>
    Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.retry.window.base</name>
  <value>3000</value>
  <description>
    Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.).
