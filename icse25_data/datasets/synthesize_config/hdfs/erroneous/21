<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.secondary.https-address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:3001</value>
  <description>
    The secondary namenode HTTPS server address and port.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained</name>
  <value>10000</value>
  <description>The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration</name>
  <value>0.32f</value>
  <description>
    *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the percentage amount of block
    invalidations (deletes) to do over a single DN heartbeat
    deletion command. The final deletion count is determined by applying this
    percentage to the number of live nodes in the system.
    The resultant number is the number of blocks from the deletion list
    chosen for proper invalidation over a single heartbeat of a single DN.
    Value should be a positive, non-zero percentage in float notation (X.Yf),
    with 1.0f meaning 100%.

<property>
  <name>nfs.server.port</name>

  <description>
      Specify the port number used by Hadoop NFS.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms</name>
  <value>1800000</value>
  <description>
    The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms</name>
  <value>150000</value>
  <description>
    How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log,
    in milliseconds.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.domain.socket.data.traffic</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    This control whether we will try to pass normal data traffic
    over UNIX domain socket rather than over TCP socket
    on node-local data transfer.
    This is currently experimental and turned off by default.

<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.rest-csrf.browser-useragents-regex</name>
  <value>^Opera.*</value>
  <description>
    A comma-separated list of regular expressions used to match against an HTTP
    request's User-Agent header when protection against cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) is enabled for WebHDFS by setting
    dfs.webhdfs.reset-csrf.enabled to true.  If the incoming User-Agent matches
    any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent
    by a browser, and therefore CSRF prevention is enforced.  If the request's
    User-Agent does not match any of these regular expressions, then the request
    is considered to be sent by something other than a browser, such as scripted
    automation.  In this case, CSRF is not a potential attack vector, so
    the prevention is not enforced.  This helps achieve backwards-compatibility
    with existing automation that has not been updated to send the CSRF
    prevention header.
