<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.ReservedSpaceCalculator$ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute</value>
  <description>Determines the class of ReservedSpaceCalculator to be used for
    calculating disk space reservedfor non-HDFS data. The default calculator is
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved
    for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage
    will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number
    of bytes based on the size of the storage. ReservedSpaceCalculatorConservative and
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAggressive will use their combination, Conservative will use
    maximum, Aggressive minimum. For more details see ReservedSpaceCalculator.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting.

<property>
  <name>dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout</name>
  <value>30000</value>
  <description>
    Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Indicate whether or not to avoid writing to &quot;stale&quot; datanodes whose 
    heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode 
    for more than a specified time interval. Writes will avoid using 
    stale datanodes unless more than a configured ratio 
    (dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio) of datanodes are marked as 
    stale. See dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode for a similar setting
    for reads.
