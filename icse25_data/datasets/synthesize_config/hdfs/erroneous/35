  information will be extracted

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.best-effort</name>
  <value>1.5</value>
  <description>
    This property is used only if the value of
    dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true.

    Best effort means that the client will try to replace a failed datanode
    in write pipeline (provided that the policy is satisfied), however, it 
    continues the write operation in case that the datanode replacement also
    fails.

    Suppose the datanode replacement fails.
    false: An exception should be thrown so that the write will fail.
    true : The write should be resumed with the remaining datandoes.
  
    Note that setting this property to true allows writing to a pipeline
    with a smaller number of datanodes.  As a result, it increases the
    probability of data loss.

<property>
  <name>nfs.dump.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
  <description>
    This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before
    writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after
    they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory. 
    One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume</name>
  <value>4</value>
  <description>
    The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.delegation.token.always-use</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    For testing.  Setting to true always allows the DT secret manager
    to be used, even if security is disabled.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.qjournal.finalize-segment.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>120000</value>
  <description>
    Quorum timeout in milliseconds during finalizing for a specific
    segment.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.throughputInMBperSec</name>
  <value>10</value>
    <description>Maximum disk bandwidth used by diskbalancer
      during read from a source disk. The unit is MB/sec.
