<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval</name>
  <value>300000</value>
  <description>
    This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.ReservedSpaceCalculator$ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute</value>
  <description>Determines the class of ReservedSpaceCalculator to be used for
    calculating disk space reservedfor non-HDFS data. The default calculator is
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved
    for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage
    will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number
    of bytes based on the size of the storage. ReservedSpaceCalculatorConservative and
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAggressive will use their combination, Conservative will use
    maximum, Aggressive minimum. For more details see ReservedSpaceCalculator.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.block.write.retries</name>
  <value>-10</value>
  <description>The number of retries for writing blocks to the data nodes, 
  before we signal failure to the application.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.shared.file.descriptor.paths</name>
  <value>/dev/shm,/tmp</value>
  <description>
    A comma-separated list of paths to use when creating file descriptors that
    will be shared between the DataNode and the DFSClient.  Typically we use
    /dev/shm, so that the file descriptors will not be written to disk.
    It tries paths in order until creation of shared memory segment succeeds.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.audit.loggers</name>
  <value>default</value>
  <description>
    List of classes implementing audit loggers that will receive audit events.
    These should be implementations of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.AuditLogger.
    The special value "default" can be used to reference the default audit
    logger, which uses the configured log system. Installing custom audit loggers
    may affect the performance and stability of the NameNode. Refer to the custom
    logger's documentation for more details.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.interval.ms</name>
  <value>2000</value>
  <description>When KeyProvider is configured, the interval time of warming
    up edek cache on NN starts up / becomes active. All edeks will be loaded
    from KMS into provider cache. The edek cache loader will try to warm up the
    cache until succeed or NN leaves active state.

<property>
  <name>dfs.checksum.combine.mode</name>
  <value>MD5MD5CRC</value>
  <description>
    Defines how lower-level chunk/block checksums are combined into file-level
    checksums; the original MD5MD5CRC mode is not comparable between files
    with different block layouts, while modes like COMPOSITE_CRC are
    comparable independently of block layout.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.failover.resolver.useFQDN</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Determines whether the resolved result is fully qualified domain name instead
    of pure IP address(es). The config name can be extended with an optional
    nameservice ID (of form dfs.client.failover.resolver.impl[.nameservice]) to
    configure specific nameservices when multiple nameservices exist.
    In secure environment, this has to be enabled since Kerberos is using fqdn
    in machine's principal therefore accessing servers by IP won't be recognized
    by the KDC.
