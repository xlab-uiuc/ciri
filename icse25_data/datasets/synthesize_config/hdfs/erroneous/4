<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.dns.interface</name>
  <value>default</value>
   <description>
     The name of the Network Interface from which a data node should
     report its IP address. e.g. eth2. This setting may be required for some
     multi-homed nodes where the DataNodes are assigned multiple hostnames
     and it is desirable for the DataNodes to use a non-default hostname.

     Prefer using hadoop.security.dns.interface over
     dfs.datanode.dns.interface.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.ratio</name>
  <value>0.2</value>
  <description>
    A ratio applied to the value of dfs.namenode.handler.count, which then
    provides the number of RPC server threads the NameNode runs for handling the
    lifeline RPC server.  For example, if dfs.namenode.handler.count is 100, and
    dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.factor is 0.10, then the NameNode starts
    100 * 0.10 = 10 threads for handling the lifeline RPC server.  It is common
    to tune the value of dfs.namenode.handler.count as a function of the number
    of DataNodes in a cluster.  Using this property allows for the lifeline RPC
    server handler threads to be tuned automatically without needing to touch a
    separate property.  Lifeline message processing is lightweight, so it is
    expected to require many fewer threads than the main NameNode RPC server.
    This property is not used if dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.count is defined,
    which sets an absolute thread count.  This property has no effect if
    dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address is not defined.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.safemode.extension</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms</name>
  <value>300000</value>
  <description>
    How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log,
    in milliseconds.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.write.max-packets-in-flight</name>
  <value>40</value>
  <description>
    The maximum number of DFSPackets allowed in flight.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.provided.acls.import.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>
      Set to true to inherit ACLs (Access Control Lists) from remote stores
      during mount. Disabled by default, i.e., ACLs are not inherited from
      remote stores. Note had HDFS ACLs have to be enabled
      (dfs.namenode.acls.enabled must be set to true) for this to take effect.

</property>

<property>
  <name>httpfs.buffer.size</name>
  <value>ciri/ciri</value>
    <description>
      The size buffer to be used when creating or opening httpfs filesystem IO stream.
