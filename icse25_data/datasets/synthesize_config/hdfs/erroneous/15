<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
  <value>file//</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
  should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
  list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
  directories, typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged
  with corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK]) for HDFS
  storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the directory does
  not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories that do not exist will
  be created if local filesystem permission allows.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS secondary
      name node should store the temporary images to merge.
      If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the image is
      replicated in all of the directories for redundancy.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    Indicate whether or not to avoid writing to &quot;stale&quot; datanodes whose 
    heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode 
    for more than a specified time interval. Writes will avoid using 
    stale datanodes unless more than a configured ratio 
    (dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio) of datanodes are marked as 
    stale. See dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode for a similar setting
    for reads.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold</name>
  <value>10737418240</value>
  <description>
    Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms</name>
  <value>30000</value>
  <description>The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a dfsclient. By default, this parameter is set to 30000
    milliseconds (30 seconds).
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.missing.checkpoint.periods.before.shutdown</name>
  <value>6</value>
  <description>
    The number of checkpoint period windows (as defined by the property
    dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period) allowed by the Namenode to perform
    saving the namespace before shutdown.
