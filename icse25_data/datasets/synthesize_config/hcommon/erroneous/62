<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.retry.throttle.interval</name>
  <value>1ms</value>
  <description>
    Initial between retry attempts on throttled requests, +/- 50%. chosen at random.
    i.e. for an intial value of 3000ms, the initial delay would be in the range 1500ms to 4500ms.
    Backoffs are exponential; again randomness is used to avoid the thundering heard problem.
    500ms is the default value used by the AWS S3 Retry policy.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.ssl.channel.mode</name>
  <value>default_jsse</value>
  <description>
    If secure connections to S3 are enabled, configures the SSL
    implementation used to encrypt connections to S3. Supported values are:
    "default_jsse", "default_jsse_with_gcm", "default", and "openssl".
    "default_jsse" uses the Java Secure Socket Extension package (JSSE).
    However, when running on Java 8, the GCM cipher is removed from the list
    of enabled ciphers. This is due to performance issues with GCM in Java 8.
    "default_jsse_with_gcm" uses the JSSE with the default list of cipher
    suites. "default_jsse_with_gcm" is equivalent to the behavior prior to
    this feature being introduced. "default" attempts to use OpenSSL rather
    than the JSSE for SSL encryption, if OpenSSL libraries cannot be loaded,
    it falls back to the "default_jsse" behavior. "openssl" attempts to use
    OpenSSL as well, but fails if OpenSSL libraries cannot be loaded.

<property>

<property>
  <name>ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive</name>
  <value>50</value>
  <description>The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider.

<property>
  <name>file.stream-buffer-size</name>
  <value>8192</value>
  <description>The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>nfs.exports.allowed.hosts</name>
  <value>* rw</value>
  <description>
    By default, the export can be mounted by any client. The value string
    contains machine name and access privilege, separated by whitespace
    characters. The machine name format can be a single host, a Java regular
    expression, or an IPv4 address. The access privilege uses rw or ro to
    specify read/write or read-only access of the machines to exports. If the
    access privilege is not provided, the default is read-only. Entries are separated by ";".
    For example: "192.168.0.0/22 rw ; host.*\.example\.com ; host1.test.org ro;".
    Only the NFS gateway needs to restart after this property is updated.
