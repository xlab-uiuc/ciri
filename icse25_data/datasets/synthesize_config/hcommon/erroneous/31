<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.connection.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>120000</value>
  <description>
    This property is the connection timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.kerberos.keytab.login.autorenewal.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>Used to enable automatic renewal of keytab based kerberos login.
    By default the automatic renewal is disabled for keytab based kerberos login.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.TemporaryAWSCredentialsProvider,org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider,com.amazonaws.auth.EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider,org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider</value>
  <description>
    Comma-separated class names of credential provider classes which implement
    com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentialsProvider.

    When S3A delegation tokens are not enabled, this list will be used
    to directly authenticate with S3 and DynamoDB services.
    When S3A Delegation tokens are enabled, depending upon the delegation
    token binding it may be used
    to communicate wih the STS endpoint to request session/role
    credentials.

    These are loaded and queried in sequence for a valid set of credentials.
    Each listed class must implement one of the following means of
    construction, which are attempted in order:
    * a public constructor accepting java.net.URI and
        org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration,
    * a public constructor accepting org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration,
    * a public static method named getInstance that accepts no
       arguments and returns an instance of
       com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentialsProvider, or
    * a public default constructor.

    Specifying org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider allows
    anonymous access to a publicly accessible S3 bucket without any credentials.
    Please note that allowing anonymous access to an S3 bucket compromises
    security and therefore is unsuitable for most use cases. It can be useful
    for accessing public data sets without requiring AWS credentials.

    If unspecified, then the default list of credential provider classes,
    queried in sequence, is:
    * org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.TemporaryAWSCredentialsProvider: looks
       for session login secrets in the Hadoop configuration.
    * org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider:
       Uses the values of fs.s3a.access.key and fs.s3a.secret.key.
    * com.amazonaws.auth.EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider: supports
        configuration of AWS access key ID and secret access key in
        environment variables named AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
        and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN as documented in the AWS SDK.
    * org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider: picks up
       IAM credentials of any EC2 VM or AWS container in which the process is running.

    \t is remapped to the TAB character, \r to CR \n to newline. \\ to \
    and \" to "

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.ssl.channel.mode</name>
  <value>default_jsse</value>
  <description>
    If secure connections to S3 are enabled, configures the SSL
    implementation used to encrypt connections to S3. Supported values are:
    "default_jsse", "default_jsse_with_gcm", "default", and "openssl".
    "default_jsse" uses the Java Secure Socket Extension package (JSSE).
    However, when running on Java 8, the GCM cipher is removed from the list
    of enabled ciphers. This is due to performance issues with GCM in Java 8.
    "default_jsse_with_gcm" uses the JSSE with the default list of cipher
    suites. "default_jsse_with_gcm" is equivalent to the behavior prior to
    this feature being introduced. "default" attempts to use OpenSSL rather
    than the JSSE for SSL encryption, if OpenSSL libraries cannot be loaded,
    it falls back to the "default_jsse" behavior. "openssl" attempts to use
    OpenSSL as well, but fails if OpenSSL libraries cannot be loaded.

<property>
  <name>io.mapfile.bloom.error.rate</name>
  <value>0.01</value>
  <description>The rate of false positives in BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile.
  As this value decreases, the size of BloomFilter-s increases exponentially. This
  value is the probability of encountering false positives (default is 0.5%).

<property>
  <name>ipc.client.idlethreshold</name>
  <value>4000000000</value>
  <description>Defines the threshold number of connections after which
               connections will be inspected for idleness.
