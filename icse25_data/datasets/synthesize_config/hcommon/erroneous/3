<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs</name>
  <value>300</value>
  <description>
    This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache
    containing the user->group mapping. When this duration has expired,
    then the implementation of the group mapping provider is invoked to get
    the groups of the user and then cached back.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>
    This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout</name>
  <value>30s</value>
    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.multipart.threshold</name>
  <value>128M</value>
  <description>How big (in bytes) to split upload or copy operations up into.
    This also controls the partition size in renamed files, as rename() involves
    copying the source file(s).
    A suffix from the set {K,M,G,T,P} may be used to scale the numeric value.

</property>

<property>
  <name>io.mapfile.bloom.error.rate</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>The rate of false positives in BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile.
  As this value decreases, the size of BloomFilter-s increases exponentially. This
  value is the probability of encountering false positives (default is 0.5%).
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>file.stream-buffer-size</name>
  <value>2048</value>
  <description>The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.user.group.static.mapping.overrides</name>
  <value>dr.who=;</value>
  <description>
    Static mapping of user to groups. This will override the groups if
    available in the system for the specified user. In other words, groups
    look-up will not happen for these users, instead groups mapped in this
    configuration will be used.
    Mapping should be in this format.
    user1=group1,group2;user2=;user3=group2;
    Default, "dr.who=;" will consider "dr.who" as user without groups.

</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.client.resolve.topology.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Whether the client machine will use the class specified by
      property net.topology.node.switch.mapping.impl to compute the network
      distance between itself and remote machines of the FileSystem. Additional
      properties might need to be configured depending on the class specified
      in net.topology.node.switch.mapping.impl. For example, if
      org.apache.hadoop.net.ScriptBasedMapping is used, a valid script file
      needs to be specified in net.topology.script.file.name.
