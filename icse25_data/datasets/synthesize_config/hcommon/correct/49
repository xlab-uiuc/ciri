<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.groups.shell.command.timeout</name>
  <value>1s</value>
  <description>
    Used by the ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping class, this property controls how
    long to wait for the underlying shell command that is run to fetch groups.
    Expressed in seconds (e.g. 10s, 1m, etc.), if the running command takes
    longer than the value configured, the command is aborted and the groups
    resolver would return a result of no groups found. A value of 0s (default)
    would mean an infinite wait (i.e. wait until the command exits on its own).

    attribute other than uidNumber.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.multiobjectdelete.enable</name>
  <value>false</value>

    Beware: legacy S3-compatible object stores might not support this request.

  <name>fs.s3a.block.size</name>
  <value>32M</value>

    A suffix from the set {K,M,G,T,P} may be used to scale the numeric value.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.list.version</name>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms</name>
  <value>5000</value>
  <description>
    The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip.
