<property>
  <name>hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout</name>
  <value>30s</value>
    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>
    Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds.
