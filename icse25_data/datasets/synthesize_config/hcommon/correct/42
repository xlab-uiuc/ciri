<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.instrumentation.requires.admin</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Indicates if administrator ACLs are required to access
    instrumentation servlets (JMX, METRICS, CONF, STACKS).

</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.before.failover</name>
  <value>6</value>
  <description>
    This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations
    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer</name>
  <value>disk</value>
  <description>
    The buffering mechanism to for data being written.
    Values: disk, array, bytebuffer.

    "disk" will use the directories listed in fs.s3a.buffer.dir as
    the location(s) to save data prior to being uploaded.

    "array" uses arrays in the JVM heap

    "bytebuffer" uses off-heap memory within the JVM.

    Both "array" and "bytebuffer" will consume memory in a single stream up to the number
    of blocks set by:

        fs.s3a.multipart.size * fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks.

    If using either of these mechanisms, keep this value low

    The total number of threads performing work across all threads is set by
    fs.s3a.threads.max, with fs.s3a.max.total.tasks values setting the number of queued
    work items.

<property>
  <name>fs.azure.authorization.caching.enable</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Config flag to enable caching of authorization results and saskeys in WASB.
    This flag is relevant only when fs.azure.authorization is enabled.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>io.mapfile.bloom.size</name>
  <value>524288</value>
  <description>The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number.

<property>
  <name>file.blocksize</name>
  <value>134217728</value>
  <description>Block size</description>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity</name>
  <value>18000</value>
  <description>
    Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.size</name>
  <value>250</value>
  <description>
    Size of the EncryptedKeyVersion cache Queue for each key
