<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.connection.timeout.ms</name>
  <value>120000</value>
  <description>
    This property is the connection timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout</name>
  <value>60s</value>
    <description>
      Timeout to wait for each shutdown operation to complete.
      If a hook takes longer than this time to complete, it will be interrupted,
      so the service will shutdown. This allows the service shutdown
      to recover from a blocked operation.
      Some shutdown hooks may need more time than this, for example when
      a large amount of data needs to be uploaded to an object store.
      In this situation: increase the timeout.

      The minimum duration of the timeout is 1 second, "1s".

<property>
  <name>fs.trash.interval</name>
  <value>1</value>

  gets deleted.  If zero, the trash feature is disabled.
  This option may be configured both on the server and the
  client. If trash is disabled server side then the client
  side configuration is checked. If trash is enabled on the
  server side then the value configured on the server is
  used and the client configuration value is ignored.
