<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback</value>
  <description>
    Class for user to group mapping (get groups for a given user) for ACL.
    The default implementation,
    org.apache.hadoop.security.JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback,
    will determine if the Java Native Interface (JNI) is available. If JNI is
    available the implementation will use the API within hadoop to resolve a
    list of groups for a user. If JNI is not available then the shell
    implementation, ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping, is used.  This implementation
    shells out to the Linux/Unix environment with the
    <code>bash -c groups</code> command to resolve a list of groups for a user.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs</name>
  <value>150</value>
  <description>
    This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache
    containing the user->group mapping. When this duration has expired,
    then the implementation of the group mapping provider is invoked to get
    the groups of the user and then cached back.

<property>
  <name>io.compression.codec.bzip2.library</name>
  <value>system-native</value>
  <description>The native-code library to be used for compression and
  decompression by the bzip2 codec.  This library could be specified
  either by by name or the full pathname.  In the former case, the
  library is located by the dynamic linker, usually searching the
  directories specified in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  The value of "system-native" indicates that the default system
  library should be used.  To indicate that the algorithm should
  operate entirely in Java, specify "java-builtin".</description>

<property>
  <name>fs.df.interval</name>
  <value>60000</value>
  <description>Disk usage statistics refresh interval in msec.</description>

  <name>ipc.client.low-latency</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>Use low-latency QoS markers for IPC connections.

<property>
  <name>net.topology.table.file.name</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
  <description> The file name for a topology file, which is used when the
    net.topology.node.switch.mapping.impl property is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.net.TableMapping. The file format is a two column text
    file, with columns separated by whitespace. The first column is a DNS or
    IP address and the second column specifies the rack where the address maps.
    If no entry corresponding to a host in the cluster is found, then
    /default-rack is assumed.

</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-origins</name>
  <value>*</value>
  <description>Comma separated list of origins that are allowed for web services
    needing cross-origin (CORS) support. If a value in the list contains an
    asterix (*), a regex pattern, escaping any dots ('.' -> '\.') and replacing
    the asterix such that it captures any characters ('*' -> '.*'), is generated.
    Values prefixed with 'regex:' are interpreted directly as regular expressions,
    e.g. use the expression 'regex:https?:\/\/foo\.bar:([0-9]+)?' to allow any
    origin using the 'http' or 'https' protocol in the domain 'foo.bar' on any
    port. The use of simple wildcards ('*') is discouraged, and only available for
    backward compatibility.</description>
