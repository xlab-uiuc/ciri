<property>
  <name>hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.cleaner.TimeToLiveProcedureWALCleaner</value>
    <description>A comma-separated list of BaseLogCleanerDelegate invoked by
    the LogsCleaner service. These WAL cleaners are called in order,
    so put the cleaner that prunes the most files in front. To
    implement your own BaseLogCleanerDelegate, just put it in HBase's classpath
    and add the fully qualified class name here. Always add the above
    default log cleaners in the list.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.blockingWaitTime</name>
  <value>90000</value>
    <description> The time for which a region will block updates after reaching the StoreFile limit
    defined by hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles. After this time has elapsed, the region will stop
    blocking updates even if a compaction has not been completed.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.storescanner.parallel.seek.enable</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      Enables StoreFileScanner parallel-seeking in StoreScanner,
      a feature which can reduce response latency under special conditions.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.cells.scanned.per.heartbeat.check</name>
  <value>10000</value>
    <description>The number of cells scanned in between heartbeat checks. Heartbeat
        checks occur during the processing of scans to determine whether or not the
        server should stop scanning in order to send back a heartbeat message to the
        client. Heartbeat messages are used to keep the client-server connection alive
        during long running scans. Small values mean that the heartbeat checks will
        occur more often and thus will provide a tighter bound on the execution time of
        the scan. Larger values mean that the heartbeat checks occur less frequently
        </description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.working.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/dir2</value>
    <description>Location where the snapshotting process will occur. The location of the
      completed snapshots will not change, but the temporary directory where the snapshot
      process occurs will be set to this location. This can be a separate filesystem than
      the root directory, for performance increase purposes. See HBASE-21098 for more
      information</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.http.filter.initializers</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.lib.StaticUserWebFilter</value>
    <description>
      A comma separated list of class names. Each class in the list must extend
      org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.FilterInitializer. The corresponding Filter will
      be initialized. Then, the Filter will be applied to all user facing jsp
      and servlet web pages.
      The ordering of the list defines the ordering of the filters.
      The default StaticUserWebFilter add a user principal as defined by the
      hbase.http.staticuser.user property.

<property>
  <name>hbase.http.max.threads</name>
  <value>8</value>
    <description>
      The maximum number of threads that the HTTP Server will create in its
      ThreadPool.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.delfile.max.count</name>
  <value>1</value>
    <description>
      The max number of del files that is allowed in the mob compaction.
      In the mob compaction, when the number of existing del files is larger than
      this value, they are merged until number of del files is not larger this value.
      The default value is 3.
