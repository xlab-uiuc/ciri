<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.optionalcacheflushinterval</name>
  <value>3600000</value>
    <description>
    Maximum amount of time an edit lives in memory before being automatically flushed.
    Default 1 hour. Set it to 0 to disable automatic flushing.

<property>
  <name>zookeeper.znode.parent</name>
  <value>/valid/file1</value>
    <description>Root ZNode for HBase in ZooKeeper. All of HBase's ZooKeeper
      files that are configured with a relative path will go under this node.
      By default, all of HBase's ZooKeeper file paths are configured with a
      relative path, so they will all go under this directory unless changed.

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak</name>
  <value>2.5</value>
    <description>Allows you to set a different (by default, more aggressive) ratio for determining
      whether larger StoreFiles are included in compactions during off-peak hours. Works in the
      same way as hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio. Only applies if hbase.offpeak.start.hour and
      hbase.offpeak.end.hour are also enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.cells.scanned.per.heartbeat.check</name>
  <value>20000</value>
    <description>The number of cells scanned in between heartbeat checks. Heartbeat
        checks occur during the processing of scans to determine whether or not the
        server should stop scanning in order to send back a heartbeat message to the
        client. Heartbeat messages are used to keep the client-server connection alive
        during long running scans. Small values mean that the heartbeat checks will
        occur more often and thus will provide a tighter bound on the execution time of
        the scan. Larger values mean that the heartbeat checks occur less frequently
        </description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.data.umask</name>
  <value>007</value>
    <description>File permissions that should be used to write data
      files when hbase.data.umask.enable is true</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.status.published</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>
      This setting activates the publication by the master of the status of the region server.
      When a region server dies and its recovery starts, the master will push this information
      to the client application, to let them cut the connection immediately instead of waiting
      for a timeout.

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.filter.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rest.filter.GzipFilter</value>
    <description>
      Servlet filters for REST service.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.wait.on.service.seconds</name>
  <value>30</value>
    <description>Default is 5 minutes. Make it 30 seconds for tests. See
    HBASE-19794 for some context.</description>
