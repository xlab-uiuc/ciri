<property>
  <name>hbase.local.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
    <description>Directory on the local filesystem to be used
    as a local storage.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit</name>
  <value>2000</value>
    <description>
      Limit for the number of regions after which no more region splitting
      should take place. This is not hard limit for the number of regions
      but acts as a guideline for the regionserver to stop splitting after
      a certain limit. Default is set to 1000.

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.peerport</name>
  <value>5776</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other.
    See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_RunningReplicatedZooKeeper
    for more information.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.offpeak.end.hour</name>
  <value>-2</value>
    <description>The end of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive. Set
      to -1 to disable off-peak.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.majorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by
      major compactions. Setting it to true helps prevent major compactions from
      polluting the page cache, which is almost always required, especially for clusters
      with low/moderate memory to storage ratio.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.auth.key.update.interval</name>
  <value>86400000</value>
    <description>The update interval for master key for authentication tokens
    in servers in milliseconds.  Only used when HBase security is enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.domain.socket.path</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
    <description>
      This is a path to a UNIX domain socket that will be used for
      communication between the DataNode and local HDFS clients, if
      dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is set to true. If the string "_PORT" is
      present in this path, it will be replaced by the TCP port of the DataNode.
      Be careful about permissions for the directory that hosts the shared
      domain socket; dfsclient will complain if open to other users than the HBase user.

</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.server.scanner.max.result.size</name>
  <value>209715200</value>
    <description>Maximum number of bytes returned when calling a scanner's next method.
    Note that when a single row is larger than this limit the row is still returned completely.
    The default value is 100MB.
    This is a safety setting to protect the server from OOM situations.
