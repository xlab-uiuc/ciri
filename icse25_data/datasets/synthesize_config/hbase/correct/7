<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.handler.factor</name>
  <value>0.1</value>
    <description>Factor to determine the number of call queues.
      A value of 0 means a single queue shared between all the handlers.
      A value of 1 means that each handler has its own queue.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.peerport</name>
  <value>2888</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other.
    See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_RunningReplicatedZooKeeper
    for more information.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.server.versionfile.writeattempts</name>
  <value>6</value>
    <description>
    How many times to retry attempting to write a version file
    before just aborting. Each attempt is separated by the
    hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.blockingWaitTime</name>
  <value>45000</value>
    <description> The time for which a region will block updates after reaching the StoreFile limit
    defined by hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles. After this time has elapsed, the region will stop
    blocking updates even if a compaction has not been completed.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.keytab.file</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
    <description>Full path to the kerberos keytab file to use for logging in
    the configured HRegionServer server principal.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.abortonerror</name>
  <value>false</value>
      <description>Set to true to cause the hosting server (master or regionserver)
      to abort if a coprocessor fails to load, fails to initialize, or throws an
      unexpected Throwable object. Setting this to false will allow the server to
      continue execution but the system wide state of the coprocessor in question
      will become inconsistent as it will be properly executing in only a subset
      of servers, so this is most useful for debugging only.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.threads.max</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid OOM issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.master.timeout.millis</name>
  <value>300000</value>
    <description>
       Timeout for master for the snapshot procedure execution.
    </description>
