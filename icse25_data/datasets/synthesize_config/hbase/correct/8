<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.handler.factor</name>
  <value>0.1</value>
    <description>Factor to determine the number of call queues.
      A value of 0 means a single queue shared between all the handlers.
      A value of 1 means that each handler has its own queue.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
    <description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
      which a region server should use to determine the host name used by the
      master for communication and display purposes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.offpeak.start.hour</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>The start of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.
      Set to -1 to disable off-peak.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.higher.bound</name>
  <value>104857600</value>
    <description>The target upper bound on aggregate compaction throughput, in bytes/sec. Allows
    you to control aggregate compaction throughput demand when the
    PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController throughput controller is active. (It is active by
    default.) The maximum throughput will be tuned between the lower and upper bounds when
    compaction pressure is within the range [0.0, 1.0]. If compaction pressure is 1.0 or greater
    the higher bound will be ignored until pressure returns to the normal range.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.column.max.version</name>
  <value>1</value>
    <description>New column family descriptors will use this value as the default number of versions
      to keep.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest-csrf.browser-useragents-regex</name>
  <value>^Mozilla.*</value>
  <description>
    A comma-separated list of regular expressions used to match against an HTTP
    request's User-Agent header when protection against cross-site request
    forgery (CSRF) is enabled for REST server by setting
    hbase.rest.csrf.enabled to true.  If the incoming User-Agent matches
    any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent
    by a browser, and therefore CSRF prevention is enforced.  If the request's
    User-Agent does not match any of these regular expressions, then the request
    is considered to be sent by something other than a browser, such as scripted
    automation.  In this case, CSRF is not a potential attack vector, so
    the prevention is not enforced.  This helps achieve backwards-compatibility
    with existing automation that has not been updated to send the CSRF
    prevention header.

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.cache.evict.remain.ratio</name>
  <value>0.5f</value>
    <description>
      The ratio (between 0.0 and 1.0) of files that remains cached after an eviction
      is triggered when the number of cached mob files exceeds the hbase.mob.file.cache.size.
      The default value is 0.5f.

<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold</name>
  <value>2500</value>
    <description>
      Number of rows in a batch operation above which a warning will be logged.
