<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.dns.interface</name>
  <value>eth2</value>
    <description>The name of the Network Interface from which a ZooKeeper server
      should report its IP address.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.write.buffer</name>
  <value>2097152</value>
    <description>Default size of the BufferedMutator write buffer in bytes.
    A bigger buffer takes more memory -- on both the client and server
    side since server instantiates the passed write buffer to process
    it -- but a larger buffer size reduces the number of RPCs made.
    For an estimate of server-side memory-used, evaluate
    hbase.client.write.buffer * hbase.regionserver.handler.count</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.normalizer.period</name>
  <value>150000</value>
    <description>Period at which the region normalizer runs in the Master.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency</name>
  <value>10000</value>
    <description>Time to sleep in between searches for work (in milliseconds).
    Used as sleep interval by service threads such as log roller.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.majorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by
      major compactions. Setting it to true helps prevent major compactions from
      polluting the page cache, which is almost always required, especially for clusters
      with low/moderate memory to storage ratio.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.cells.scanned.per.heartbeat.check</name>
  <value>20000</value>
    <description>The number of cells scanned in between heartbeat checks. Heartbeat
        checks occur during the processing of scans to determine whether or not the
        server should stop scanning in order to send back a heartbeat message to the
        client. Heartbeat messages are used to keep the client-server connection alive
        during long running scans. Small values mean that the heartbeat checks will
        occur more often and thus will provide a tighter bound on the execution time of
        the scan. Larger values mean that the heartbeat checks occur less frequently
        </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.server.compactchecker.interval.multiplier</name>
  <value>2000</value>
    <description>The number that determines how often we scan to see if compaction is necessary.
        Normally, compactions are done after some events (such as memstore flush), but if
        region didn't receive a lot of writes for some time, or due to different compaction
        policies, it may be necessary to check it periodically. The interval between checks is
        hbase.server.compactchecker.interval.multiplier multiplied by
        hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.lease.recovery.dfs.timeout</name>
  <value>64000</value>
    <description>How long between dfs recover lease invocations. Should be larger than the sum of
        the time it takes for the namenode to issue a block recovery command as part of
        datanode; dfs.heartbeat.interval and the time it takes for the primary
        datanode, performing block recovery to timeout on a dead datanode; usually
        dfs.client.socket-timeout. See the end of HBASE-8389 for more.</description>
