<property>
  <name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.scan.ratio</name>
  <value>0</value>
    <description>Given the number of read call queues, calculated from the total number
      of call queues multiplied by the callqueue.read.ratio, the scan.ratio property
      will split the read call queues into small-read and long-read queues.
      A value lower than 0.5 means that there will be less long-read queues than short-read queues.
      A value of 0.5 means that there will be the same number of short-read and long-read queues.
      A value greater than 0.5 means that there will be more long-read queues than short-read queues
      A value of 0 or 1 indicate to use the same set of queues for gets and scans.

      Example: Given the total number of read call queues being 8
      a scan.ratio of 0 or 1 means that: 8 queues will contain both long and short read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.3 means that: 2 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 6 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.5 means that: 4 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 4 queues will contain only short-read requests.
      a scan.ratio of 0.8 means that: 6 queues will contain only long-read requests
      and 2 queues will contain only short-read requests.

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.max.total.tasks</name>
  <value>60</value>
    <description>The maximum number of concurrent mutation tasks a single HTable instance will
    send to the cluster.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks</name>
  <value>100</value>
    <description>The maximum number of concurrent mutation tasks the client will
    maintain to a single Region. That is, if there is already
    hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks writes in progress for this region, new puts
    won't be sent to this region until some writes finishes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.restore.take.failsafe.snapshot</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Set to true to take a snapshot before the restore operation.
      The snapshot taken will be used in case of failure, to restore the previous state.
      At the end of the restore operation this snapshot will be deleted</description>

<property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.http.filter.initializers</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.lib.StaticUserWebFilter</value>
    <description>
      A comma separated list of class names. Each class in the list must extend
      org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.FilterInitializer. The corresponding Filter will
      be initialized. Then, the Filter will be applied to all user facing jsp
      and servlet web pages.
      The ordering of the list defines the ordering of the filters.
      The default StaticUserWebFilter add a user principal as defined by the
      hbase.http.staticuser.user property.

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.cache.evict.period</name>
  <value>1800</value>
    <description>
      The amount of time in seconds before the mob cache evicts cached mob files.
      The default value is 3600 seconds.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.compaction.batch.size</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>
      The max number of the mob files that is allowed in a batch of the mob compaction.
      The mob compaction merges the small mob files to bigger ones. If the number of the
      small files is very large, it could lead to a "too many opened file handlers" in the merge.
      And the merge has to be split into batches. This value limits the number of mob files
      that are selected in a batch of the mob compaction. The default value is 100.
