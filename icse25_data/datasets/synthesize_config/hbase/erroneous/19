<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.handler.count</name>
  <value>30</value>
    <description>Count of RPC Listener instances spun up on RegionServers.
      Same property is used by the Master for count of master handlers.
      Too many handlers can be counter-productive. Make it a multiple of
      CPU count. If mostly read-only, handlers count close to cpu count
      does well. Start with twice the CPU count and tune from there.</description>

<property>
  <name>zookeeper.session.timeout</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. It is used in two different ways.
      First, this value is used in the ZK client that HBase uses to connect to the ensemble.
      It is also used by HBase when it starts a ZK server and it is passed as the 'maxSessionTimeout'.
      See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions.
      For example, if an HBase region server connects to a ZK ensemble that's also managed
      by HBase, then the session timeout will be the one specified by this configuration.
      But, a region server that connects to an ensemble managed with a different configuration
      will be subjected that ensemble's maxSessionTimeout. So, even though HBase might propose
      using 90 seconds, the ensemble can have a max timeout lower than this and it will take
      precedence. The current default maxSessionTimeout that ZK ships with is 40 seconds, which is lower than
      HBase's.

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
    <description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
      which a ZooKeeper server should use to determine the host name used by the
      master for communication and display purposes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks</name>
  <value>0</value>
    <description>The maximum number of concurrent mutation tasks the client will
    maintain to a single Region. That is, if there is already
    hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks writes in progress for this region, new puts
    won't be sent to this region until some writes finishes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period</name>
  <value>30000</value>
    <description>Client scanner lease period in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle</name>
  <value>2684354560</value>
    <description>There are two different thread pools for compactions, one for large compactions and
      the other for small compactions. This helps to keep compaction of lean tables (such as
      hbase:meta) fast. If a compaction is larger than this threshold, it
      goes into the large compaction pool. In most cases, the default value is appropriate. Default:
      2 x hbase.hstore.compaction.max x hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size (which defaults to 128MB).
      The value field assumes that the value of hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size is unchanged from
      the default.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.rest.threads.max</name>
  <value>50</value>
    <description>The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid OOM issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.snapshot.restore.failsafe.name</name>
  <value>hbase-failsafe-{snapshot.name}-{restore.timestamp}</value>
    <description>Name of the failsafe snapshot taken by the restore operation.
      You can use the {snapshot.name}, {table.name} and {restore.timestamp} variables
      to create a name based on what you are restoring.</description>
