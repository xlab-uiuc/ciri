<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.handler.count</name>
  <value>15</value>
    <description>Count of RPC Listener instances spun up on RegionServers.
      Same property is used by the Master for count of master handlers.
      Too many handlers can be counter-productive. Make it a multiple of
      CPU count. If mostly read-only, handlers count close to cpu count
      does well. Start with twice the CPU count and tune from there.</description>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.msginterval</name>
  <value>6000</value>
    <description>Interval between messages from the RegionServer to Master
    in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.peerport</name>
  <value>1444</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other.
    See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_RunningReplicatedZooKeeper
    for more information.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
  <value>1090</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The port at which the clients will connect.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold</name>
  <value>4000000000</value>
    <description>The max number of concurrent pending requests for one server in all client threads
    (process level). Exceeding requests will be thrown ServerTooBusyException immediately to prevent
    user's threads being occupied and blocked by only one slow region server. If you use a fix
    number of threads to access HBase in a synchronous way, set this to a suitable value which is
    related to the number of threads will help you. See
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16388 for details.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.server.keyvalue.maxsize</name>
  <value>10485760</value>
    <description>Maximum allowed size of an individual cell, inclusive of value and all key
    components. A value of 0 or less disables the check.
    The default value is 10MB.
    This is a safety setting to protect the server from OOM situations.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.majorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by
      major compactions. Setting it to true helps prevent major compactions from
      polluting the page cache, which is almost always required, especially for clusters
      with low/moderate memory to storage ratio.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed</name>
  <value>false</value>
    <description>Use Thrift TFramedTransport on the server side.
      This is the recommended transport for thrift servers and requires a similar setting
      on the client side. Changing this to false will select the default transport,
      vulnerable to DoS when malformed requests are issued due to THRIFT-601.
