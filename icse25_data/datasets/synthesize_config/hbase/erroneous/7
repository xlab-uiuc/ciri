<property>
  <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
  <value>tmp////staging</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default, we write
    to whatever ${hbase.tmp.dir} is set too -- usually /tmp --
    so change this configuration or else all data will be lost on
    machine restart.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.local.dir</name>
  <value>/valid/file1</value>
    <description>Directory on the local filesystem to be used
    as a local storage.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl</name>
  <value>300000</value>
    <description>How long a WAL remain in the archive ({hbase.rootdir}/oldWALs) directory,
    after which it will be cleaned by a Master thread. The value is in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.thrift.maxWorkerThreads</name>
  <value>500</value>
    <description>The maximum size of the thread pool. When the pending request queue
    overflows, new threads are created until their number reaches this number.
    After that, the server starts dropping connections.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.thrift.maxQueuedRequests</name>
  <value>2000</value>
    <description>The maximum number of pending Thrift connections waiting in the queue. If
     there are no idle threads in the pool, the server queues requests. Only
     when the queue overflows, new threads are added, up to
     hbase.thrift.maxQueuedRequests threads.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.thrift.framed</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Use Thrift TFramedTransport on the server side.
      This is the recommended transport for thrift servers and requires a similar setting
      on the client side. Changing this to false will select the default transport,
      vulnerable to DoS when malformed requests are issued due to THRIFT-601.

<property>
  <name>hbase.status.multicast.address.ip</name>
  <value>127.0.0.1</value>
    <description>
      Multicast address to use for the status publication by multicast.
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.file.cache.size</name>
  <value>500</value>
    <description>
      Number of opened file handlers to cache.
      A larger value will benefit reads by providing more file handlers per mob
      file cache and would reduce frequent file opening and closing.
      However, if this is set too high, this could lead to a "too many opened file handlers"
      The default value is 1000.
