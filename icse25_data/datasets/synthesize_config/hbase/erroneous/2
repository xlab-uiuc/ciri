<property>
  <name>zookeeper.recovery.retry.maxsleeptime</name>
  <value>120000</value>
    <description>Max sleep time before retry zookeeper operations in milliseconds,
    a max time is needed here so that sleep time won't grow unboundedly
    </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl</name>
  <value>-5.5</value>
    <description>How long a WAL remain in the archive ({hbase.rootdir}/oldWALs) directory,
    after which it will be cleaned by a Master thread. The value is in milliseconds.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold</name>
  <value>3</value>
    <description> If more than this number of StoreFiles exist in any one Store
      (one StoreFile is written per flush of MemStore), a compaction is run to rewrite all
      StoreFiles into a single StoreFile. Larger values delay compaction, but when compaction does
      occur, it takes longer to complete.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.hstore.compaction.max</name>
  <value>10</value>
    <description>The maximum number of StoreFiles which will be selected for a single minor
      compaction, regardless of the number of eligible StoreFiles. Effectively, the value of
      hbase.hstore.compaction.max controls the length of time it takes a single compaction to
      complete. Setting it larger means that more StoreFiles are included in a compaction. For most
      cases, the default value is appropriate.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.offpeak.end.hour</name>
  <value>-2</value>
    <description>The end of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive. Set
      to -1 to disable off-peak.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.operation.timeout</name>
  <value>2400000</value>
    <description>Operation timeout is a top-level restriction (millisecond) that makes sure a
      blocking operation in Table will not be blocked more than this. In each operation, if rpc
      request fails because of timeout or other reason, it will retry until success or throw
      RetriesExhaustedException. But if the total time being blocking reach the operation timeout
      before retries exhausted, it will break early and throw SocketTimeoutException.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.table.lock.enable</name>
  <value>true</value>
    <description>Set to true to enable locking the table in zookeeper for schema change operations.
    Table locking from master prevents concurrent schema modifications to corrupt table
    state.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.mob.cache.evict.remain.ratio</name>
  <value>0.5f</value>
    <description>
      The ratio (between 0.0 and 1.0) of files that remains cached after an eviction
      is triggered when the number of cached mob files exceeds the hbase.mob.file.cache.size.
      The default value is 0.5f.
