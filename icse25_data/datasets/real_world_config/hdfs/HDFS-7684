<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
  <description>
    The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS) which a DataNode
    should use to determine its own host name.

    Prefer using hadoop.security.dns.nameserver over
    dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.read.considerLoad</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Decide if sort block locations considers the target's load or not when read.
    Turn off by default.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.ReservedSpaceCalculator$ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute</value>
  <description>Determines the class of ReservedSpaceCalculator to be used for
    calculating disk space reservedfor non-HDFS data. The default calculator is
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved
    for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage
    will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number
    of bytes based on the size of the storage. ReservedSpaceCalculatorConservative and
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAggressive will use their combination, Conservative will use
    maximum, Aggressive minimum. For more details see ReservedSpaceCalculator.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis</name>
  <value>1200000</value>
  <description>The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>
      Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby
      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.secondary.http-address</name>
  <value>0.0.0.0:500090</value>
  <description>
    The secondary namenode http server address and port.

</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.tail-edits.period</name>
  <value>60s</value>
  <description>
    How often, the StandbyNode and ObserverNode should check if there are new
    edit log entries ready to be consumed. This is the minimum period between
    checking; exponential backoff will be applied if no edits are found and
    dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max is configured. By default, no
    backoff is applied.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
