<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver</name>
  <value>default</value>
  <description>
    The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS) which a DataNode
    should use to determine its own host name.

    Prefer using hadoop.security.dns.nameserver over
    dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver.

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.read.considerLoad</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Decide if sort block locations considers the target's load or not when read.
    Turn off by default.

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.impl.ReservedSpaceCalculator$ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute</value>
  <description>Determines the class of ReservedSpaceCalculator to be used for
    calculating disk space reservedfor non-HDFS data. The default calculator is
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAbsolute which will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved
    for a static reserved number of bytes. ReservedSpaceCalculatorPercentage
    will use dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct to calculate the reserved number
    of bytes based on the size of the storage. ReservedSpaceCalculatorConservative and
    ReservedSpaceCalculatorAggressive will use their combination, Conservative will use
    maximum, Aggressive minimum. For more details see ReservedSpaceCalculator.

<property>
  <name>dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis</name>
  <value>1200000</value>
  <description>The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
  <value>/p1,/p2,/p3</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
  should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
  list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
  directories, typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged
  with corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK]) for HDFS
  storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the directory does
  not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories that do not exist will
  be created if local filesystem permission allows.

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.tail-edits.period</name>
  <value>60s</value>
  <description>
    How often, the StandbyNode and ObserverNode should check if there are new
    edit log entries ready to be consumed. This is the minimum period between
    checking; exponential backoff will be applied if no edits are found and
    dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max is configured. By default, no
    backoff is applied.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.

<property>
  <name>dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.keytab.file</name>
  <value>/valid/file2</value>
  <description>
    The keytab file used by external StoragePolicySatisfier to login as its
    service principal. The principal name is configured with
    dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.kerberos.principal. Keytab based login
    is required when dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.mode is external.
