<property>
  <name>hbase.master.port</name>
  <value>16000</value>
    <description>The port the HBase Master should bind to.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.cleaner.TimeToLiveProcedureWALCleaner</value>
    <description>A comma-separated list of BaseLogCleanerDelegate invoked by
    the LogsCleaner service. These WAL cleaners are called in order,
    so put the cleaner that prunes the most files in front. To
    implement your own BaseLogCleanerDelegate, just put it in HBase's classpath
    and add the fully qualified class name here. Always add the above
    default log cleaners in the list.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.client.retries.number</name>
  <value>30</value>
    <description>Maximum retries.  Used as maximum for all retryable
    operations such as the getting of a cell's value, starting a row update,
    etc.  Retry interval is a rough function based on hbase.client.pause.  At
    first we retry at this interval but then with backoff, we pretty quickly reach
    retrying every ten seconds.  See HConstants#RETRY_BACKOFF for how the backup
    ramps up.  Change this setting and hbase.client.pause to suit your workload.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hfile.index.block.max.size</name>
  <value>131072</value>
      <description>When the size of a leaf-level, intermediate-level, or root-level
          index block in a multi-level block index grows to this size, the
          block is written out and a new block is started.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.auth.key.update.interval</name>
  <value>172800000</value>
    <description>The update interval for master key for authentication tokens
    in servers in milliseconds.  Only used when HBase security is enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.auth.token.max.lifetime</name>
  <value>1209600000</value>
    <description>The maximum lifetime in milliseconds after which an
    authentication token expires.  Only used when HBase security is enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period</name>
  <value>-1</value>
    <description>
      The period (in milliseconds) for refreshing the store files for the secondary regions. 0
      means this feature is disabled. Secondary regions sees new files (from flushes and
      compactions) from primary once the secondary region refreshes the list of files in the
      region (there is no notification mechanism). But too frequent refreshes might cause
      extra Namenode pressure. If the files cannot be refreshed for longer than HFile TTL
      (hbase.master.hfilecleaner.ttl) the requests are rejected. Configuring HFile TTL to a larger
      value is also recommended with this setting.
