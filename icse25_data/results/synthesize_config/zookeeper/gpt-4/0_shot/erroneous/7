{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['dataLogDir', 'maxSessionTimeout', 'autopurge.purgeInterval'], 'reason': ["The path for 'dataLogDir' should not contain multiple slashes or backslashes. It should be a valid directory path.", "'maxSessionTimeout' should be greater than 0. A value of 0 is not valid as it would disable session timeouts entirely.", "'autopurge.purgeInterval' should be a positive integer. A value of -1 is not valid as it would disable the autopurge feature, which is not recommended."]}
