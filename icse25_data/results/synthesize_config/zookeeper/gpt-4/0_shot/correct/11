{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['minSessionTimeout', 'clientPort', 'secureClientPort'], 'reason': ["The 'minSessionTimeout' value should be greater than 0.", "Having 'clientPort' and 'secureClientPort' with the same value may lead to conflicts. Typically, these should be on different ports if both are being used.", "The 'secureClientPort' should not be the same as 'clientPort' to avoid port conflicts."]}
