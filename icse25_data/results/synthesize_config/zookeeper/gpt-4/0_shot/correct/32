Final result:

There are 6 misconfiguration parameters in the input: localSessionsEnabled	quorum.auth.learner.saslLoginContext	quorum.auth.kerberos.servicePrincipal	portUnification	clientPortAddress	peerType
[Ciri] Reason for localSessionsEnabled: The 'localSessionsEnabled' parameter is not a recognized configuration in ZooKeeper version 3.7.0.
[Ciri] Reason for quorum.auth.learner.saslLoginContext: The 'quorum.auth.learner.saslLoginContext' parameter is not correctly formatted or is not applicable in this context. The correct property for SASL authentication contexts in ZooKeeper quorum learners should be checked in the official documentation.
[Ciri] Reason for quorum.auth.kerberos.servicePrincipal: The 'quorum.auth.kerberos.servicePrincipal' parameter format or usage might be incorrect. Ensure the service principal name (SPN) is correctly set for Kerberos authentication within ZooKeeper's quorum.
[Ciri] Reason for portUnification: The 'portUnification' parameter is not a recognized configuration in ZooKeeper version 3.7.0.
[Ciri] Reason for clientPortAddress: The 'clientPortAddress' format is generally correct, but specifying the address as '0.0.0.0' is typically used to listen on all interfaces. Ensure this is the intended configuration. The correct format is usually 'clientPort=3000'.
[Ciri] Reason for peerType: The 'peerType' parameter is valid, but ensure that 'participant' is the intended role for this ZooKeeper instance in the ensemble. The roles can be 'participant' or 'observer'.
