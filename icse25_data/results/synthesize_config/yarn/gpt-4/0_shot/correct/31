Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size', 'yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms', 'yarn.client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms'], 'reason': ["The 'yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size' should not be 0 as it would disable the threadpool, which is not recommended. A positive value is expected to ensure the scheduler invocation phase of placement constraint processing is handled correctly.", "The 'yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms' value of 1 may be too aggressive for practical use, potentially leading to performance issues due to frequent reloading. A higher value is recommended unless there's a specific need for such rapid reloading.", "The 'yarn.client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms' value of -2 is invalid. Valid values are non-negative integers or -1 for unlimited wait time. A positive value or -1 should be used to indicate the desired wait time."]}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size	yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms	yarn.client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms
[Ciri] Reason for yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size: The 'yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size' should not be 0 as it would disable the threadpool, which is not recommended. A positive value is expected to ensure the scheduler invocation phase of placement constraint processing is handled correctly.
[Ciri] Reason for yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms: The 'yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms' value of 1 may be too aggressive for practical use, potentially leading to performance issues due to frequent reloading. A higher value is recommended unless there's a specific need for such rapid reloading.
[Ciri] Reason for yarn.client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms: The 'yarn.client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms' value of -2 is invalid. Valid values are non-negative integers or -1 for unlimited wait time. A positive value or -1 should be used to indicate the desired wait time.
