Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.bind.users	io.seqfile.local.dir	fs.s3a.attempts.maximum	fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required	fs.azure.secure.mode	fs.azure.local.sas.key.mode	ha.health-monitor.connect-retry-interval.ms	hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.bind.users: The property 'hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.bind.users' is not a standard configuration property in Hadoop 3.3.0. It seems to be a custom or a misnamed property.
[Ciri] Reason for io.seqfile.local.dir: The property 'io.seqfile.local.dir' is not recognized as a standard Hadoop 3.3.0 configuration. It might be outdated or incorrectly named.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.attempts.maximum: The property 'fs.s3a.attempts.maximum' is correctly named but without context, it's unclear if the value is appropriate. This response assumes a generic validation without specific value checks.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required: The property 'fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required' is a valid configuration name, but the explanation assumes specific behavior that should be verified against the actual S3A implementation in Hadoop 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.secure.mode: The property 'fs.azure.secure.mode' is specific to Azure file systems and should be correct if Azure support is configured properly in Hadoop 3.3.0. However, without context on Azure setup, it's listed for completeness.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.local.sas.key.mode: The property 'fs.azure.local.sas.key.mode' is related to Azure configurations and its correctness depends on the Azure environment setup in Hadoop 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.health-monitor.connect-retry-interval.ms: The property 'ha.health-monitor.connect-retry-interval.ms' is a standard property and should be correct unless the specific HA setup requires different timing.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning: The property 'hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning' does not exist in the standard Hadoop 3.3.0 configuration properties. It appears to be a custom or incorrectly named property.
