Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.ftp.data.connection.mode	fs.s3a.executor.capacity	fs.permissions.umask-mode	hadoop.security.java.secure.random.algorithm	hadoop.registry.zk.retry.interval.ms	hadoop.registry.secure	hadoop.registry.system.acls	fs.getspaceused.jitterMillis
[Ciri] Reason for fs.ftp.data.connection.mode: The 'fs.ftp.data.connection.mode' property may not be applicable or correctly named for Hadoop Common version 3.3.0. Verification against the specific Hadoop version documentation is recommended.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.executor.capacity: The 'fs.s3a.executor.capacity' description suggests it controls task submission for operations excluding block uploads, which is specific to S3A filesystem operations. Ensure this property is relevant and correctly configured for your S3A client version.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.permissions.umask-mode: The 'fs.permissions.umask-mode' value and usage example provided might not align. The value is in octal, but the usage example suggests a symbolic representation. Ensure consistency and correctness.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.java.secure.random.algorithm: The 'hadoop.security.java.secure.random.algorithm' property is correctly named, but the choice of algorithm ('SHA1PRNG') should be validated as secure and appropriate for your environment.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.registry.zk.retry.interval.ms: The 'hadoop.registry.zk.retry.interval.ms' property lacks a detailed description, which might lead to misunderstandings about its purpose and correct value.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.registry.secure: The 'hadoop.registry.secure' property is correctly named, but ensure that enabling security aligns with your registry and Kerberos configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.registry.system.acls: The 'hadoop.registry.system.acls' property's value and description suggest a specific configuration for secure clusters. Ensure the SASL and Kerberos settings are correctly applied and match your security requirements.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.getspaceused.jitterMillis: The 'fs.getspaceused.jitterMillis' property is correctly named, but ensure the jitter value is appropriate for your filesystem usage statistics gathering.
