Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.AbstractFileSystem.swebhdfs.impl	fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer	fs.s3a.committer.threads	ipc.client.connect.max.retries	ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds	ftp.stream-buffer-size	ha.health-monitor.check-interval.ms	hadoop.caller.context.enabled
[Ciri] Reason for fs.AbstractFileSystem.swebhdfs.impl: The correct property name should be 'fs.AbstractFileSystem.swebhdfs.impl'. There might be a typo or incorrect property name.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer: The 'fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer' might not be applicable for all configurations or could be incorrectly specified.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.committer.threads: The 'fs.s3a.committer.threads' value is typically configured based on specific use cases. The provided value might not be optimal.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.connect.max.retries: The 'ipc.client.connect.max.retries' property is correctly named but the optimal value can vary based on network reliability.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds: The 'ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds' property contains placeholders which should be replaced with actual values.
[Ciri] Reason for ftp.stream-buffer-size: The 'ftp.stream-buffer-size' is correctly named but the optimal buffer size can vary based on specific use cases.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.health-monitor.check-interval.ms: The 'ha.health-monitor.check-interval.ms' property is correctly named but the interval might need adjustment based on the HA setup.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.caller.context.enabled: The 'hadoop.caller.context.enabled' property is correctly named but enabling or disabling it depends on auditing requirements.
