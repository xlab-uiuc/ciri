Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: io.seqfile.local.dir	fs.azure.sas.expiry.period	fs.azure.authorization.caching.enable	ipc.server.listen.queue.size	ftp.stream-buffer-size	hadoop.http.authentication.kerberos.keytab	hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-headers	ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms
[Ciri] Reason for io.seqfile.local.dir: The property name 'io.seqfile.local.dir' does not exist in Hadoop Common version 3.3.0. It might be a custom or deprecated property.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.sas.expiry.period: The property 'fs.azure.sas.expiry.period' is specific to Azure file systems and may not be recognized without the appropriate Azure Hadoop file system library.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.authorization.caching.enable: The property 'fs.azure.authorization.caching.enable' is specific to Azure file systems and may not be recognized without the appropriate Azure Hadoop file system library.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.server.listen.queue.size: The property 'ipc.server.listen.queue.size' is not documented as a standard Hadoop Common configuration as of version 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for ftp.stream-buffer-size: The property 'ftp.stream-buffer-size' is not a recognized Hadoop Common configuration property in version 3.3.0. It might be specific to certain Hadoop ecosystem applications or custom implementations.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.http.authentication.kerberos.keytab: The property 'hadoop.http.authentication.kerberos.keytab' is generally valid, but the specific usage and naming convention might vary between different Hadoop components and versions.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-headers: The property 'hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-headers' is generally related to web interface configurations in Hadoop, but its exact name and usage might vary.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms: The property 'ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms' is related to High Availability (HA) configurations. However, the exact property name and its relevance might vary across different Hadoop versions and distributions.
