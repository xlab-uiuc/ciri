Raw json:

Property names are typically static and do not include variable sections.", "The property 'adl.feature.ownerandgroup.enableupn' is specific to Azure Data Lake (ADL) and may not be applicable or recognized in a generic Hadoop (hcommon) configuration context.", "The property 'hadoop.prometheus.endpoint.enabled' might not be recognized in Hadoop version 3.3.0 as Prometheus support for metrics was introduced in later versions of Hadoop."]}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: ipc.[port_number].faircallqueue.multiplexer.weights	adl.feature.ownerandgroup.enableupn	hadoop.prometheus.endpoint.enabled
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].faircallqueue.multiplexer.weights: The property name 'ipc.[port_number].faircallqueue.multiplexer.weights' uses a placeholder '[port_number]' which is not a standard convention in configuration files. Property names are typically static and do not include variable sections.
[Ciri] Reason for adl.feature.ownerandgroup.enableupn: The property 'adl.feature.ownerandgroup.enableupn' is specific to Azure Data Lake (ADL) and may not be applicable or recognized in a generic Hadoop (hcommon) configuration context.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.prometheus.endpoint.enabled: The property 'hadoop.prometheus.endpoint.enabled' might not be recognized in Hadoop version 3.3.0 as Prometheus support for metrics was introduced in later versions of Hadoop.
