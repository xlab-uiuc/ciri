Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs	fs.s3a.socket.recv.buffer	fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.max.retries	io.mapfile.bloom.error.rate	ipc.client.connection.maxidletime	ipc.client.connect.timeout	hadoop.security.crypto.cipher.suite	hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs: The 'usage' field is not a standard configuration property attribute and should not be included.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.socket.recv.buffer: The 'fs.s3a.socket.recv.buffer' property might be correct, but without specific context on the version and configurations of the Hadoop AWS module, it's not possible to validate its correctness.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.max.retries: The 'fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.max.retries' property is related to S3Guard, which has been deprecated in favor of S3A's metadata store in later versions of Hadoop. Its relevance depends on the usage of S3Guard.
[Ciri] Reason for io.mapfile.bloom.error.rate: The description of 'io.mapfile.bloom.error.rate' lacks detail on the impact of changing the error rate beyond false positives, such as performance implications.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.connection.maxidletime: The 'ipc.client.connection.maxidletime' and 'ipc.client.connect.timeout' properties are correctly defined but require validation against network and server performance to ensure they are set to optimal values.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.connect.timeout: The 'hadoop.security.crypto.cipher.suite' property is correctly defined, but the choice of cipher suite should be validated against current security standards and requirements.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.crypto.cipher.suite: The 'hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning' property's default value is correctly set to 'false', but the decision to suppress warnings should be carefully considered in the context of the deployment environment.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.shell.missing.defaultFs.warning:
