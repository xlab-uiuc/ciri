Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.ftp.transfer.mode	fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.throttle.retry.interval	fs.AbstractFileSystem.abfss.impl	ipc.[port_number].backoff.enable	ipc.[port_number].scheduler.impl	hadoop.zk.num-retries	hadoop.domainname.resolver.impl	hadoop.http.sni.host.check.enabled
[Ciri] Reason for fs.ftp.transfer.mode: The 'fs.ftp.transfer.mode' property does not exist in Hadoop Common version 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.throttle.retry.interval: The 'fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.throttle.retry.interval' property is related to S3Guard, which has been removed in Hadoop 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.AbstractFileSystem.abfss.impl: The 'fs.AbstractFileSystem.abfss.impl' property syntax is incorrect. It should be 'fs.AbstractFileSystem.abfss.impl' for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].backoff.enable: The 'ipc.[port_number].backoff.enable' property uses a placeholder '[port_number]' which should be replaced with an actual port number or removed if it's not applicable.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].scheduler.impl: The 'ipc.[port_number].scheduler.impl' property uses a placeholder '[port_number]' which should be replaced with an actual port number or removed if it's not applicable.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.zk.num-retries: The 'hadoop.zk.num-retries' property does not have a known issue, but without context, it's unclear if the value '1000' is appropriate.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.domainname.resolver.impl: The 'hadoop.domainname.resolver.impl' property does not have a known issue, but the explanation provided does not clearly indicate a mistake without further context.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.http.sni.host.check.enabled: The 'hadoop.http.sni.host.check.enabled' property does not have a known issue, but the explanation provided does not clearly indicate a mistake without further context.
