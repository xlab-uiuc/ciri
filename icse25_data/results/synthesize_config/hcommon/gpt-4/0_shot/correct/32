Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.table.capacity.write	fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled	fs.wasb.impl	ipc.server.reuseaddr	tfile.fs.input.buffer.size	ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms	ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.rpc-timeout.ms	hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.num.refill.threads
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.table.capacity.write: The 'fs.s3a.s3guard.ddb.table.capacity.write' property is deprecated as S3Guard has been removed in Hadoop 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled: The 'fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled' property is related to S3Guard, which is not supported in Hadoop 3.3.0.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.wasb.impl: The 'fs.wasb.impl' property is correctly defined, but ensure Azure support is included in your Hadoop build.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.server.reuseaddr: The 'ipc.server.reuseaddr' property is valid, but ensure it is set according to your network and OS requirements.
[Ciri] Reason for tfile.fs.input.buffer.size: The 'tfile.fs.input.buffer.size' property is valid, but ensure the buffer size is optimized for your workload.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms: The 'ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms' property is valid, but ensure the timeout is appropriate for your HA setup.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.rpc-timeout.ms: The 'ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.rpc-timeout.ms' property is valid, but ensure the timeout suits your failover strategy.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.num.refill.threads: The 'hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.num.refill.threads' property is valid, but ensure the number of threads is optimized for your security requirements.
