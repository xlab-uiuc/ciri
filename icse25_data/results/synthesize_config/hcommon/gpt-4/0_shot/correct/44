Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hadoop.security.group.mapping	hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs	io.compression.codec.bzip2.library	fs.df.interval	ipc.client.low-latency	net.topology.table.file.name	hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-origins	hadoop.registry.zk.connection.timeout.ms
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.group.mapping: The 'hadoop.security.group.mapping' property's default value is usually 'org.apache.hadoop.security.ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping'. The mentioned class might not be the default or recommended unless specific JNI-based group mapping is required.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs: The 'hadoop.security.groups.cache.secs' property is correctly described but without context, it's hard to determine if 150 seconds is an appropriate value for all setups. This value might need adjustment based on the environment.
[Ciri] Reason for io.compression.codec.bzip2.library: The 'io.compression.codec.bzip2.library' property's value 'system-native' is correct, but specifying 'java-builtin' for purely Java-based compression might not always be optimal for performance.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.df.interval: The 'fs.df.interval' property's value of 60000 milliseconds (1 minute) is a reasonable default, but for systems with high I/O, a longer interval might reduce system load.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.low-latency: The 'ipc.client.low-latency' property is set to false by default, which is suitable for most cases. However, for high-performance computing scenarios, enabling low latency might be beneficial.
[Ciri] Reason for net.topology.table.file.name: The 'net.topology.table.file.name' property is correctly set to use a custom topology file. However, the file path and name should be carefully checked to ensure they are correct and accessible.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-origins: The 'hadoop.http.cross-origin.allowed-origins' property is set to '*', which allows all origins. This setting might pose a security risk if the Hadoop cluster is accessible over the Internet.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.registry.zk.connection.timeout.ms: The 'hadoop.registry.zk.connection.timeout.ms' property's value of 15000 milliseconds (15 seconds) is a reasonable default, but depending on the network conditions, this might need to be adjusted.
