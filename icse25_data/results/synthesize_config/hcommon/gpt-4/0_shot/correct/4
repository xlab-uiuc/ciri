Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: io.erasurecode.codec.rs-legacy.rawcoders	fs.s3a.retry.interval	fs.s3a.select.enabled	fs.permissions.umask-mode	ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries	ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.connection.retries	hadoop.zk.acl
[Ciri] Reason for io.erasurecode.codec.rs-legacy.rawcoders: The property 'io.erasurecode.codec.rs-legacy.rawcoders' is specific to Hadoop erasure coding and may not be applicable or recognized in all Hadoop versions, especially if erasure coding is not supported or differently implemented.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.retry.interval: The format '500ms' for 'fs.s3a.retry.interval' might not be recognized. Usually, Hadoop configurations expect time values in milliseconds as integers without specifying units.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.select.enabled: The property 'fs.s3a.select.enabled' might not be recognized if the Hadoop version in use does not support S3 Select or if the property name has changed.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.permissions.umask-mode: The usage example for 'fs.permissions.umask-mode' is unnecessary and potentially confusing in the configuration file. Configuration files typically do not include usage examples.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries: The property 'ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries' might not be recognized if the Hadoop version does not support HA or if the property name has changed.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.connection.retries: The property 'ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.connection.retries' might not be recognized if the Hadoop version does not support HA or if the property name has changed.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.zk.acl: The property 'hadoop.zk.acl' might not be recognized if the Hadoop version does not use ZooKeeper for HA or if the property name has changed.
