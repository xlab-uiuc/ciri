Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.azure.user.agent.prefix	fs.AbstractFileSystem.ftp.impl	fs.s3a.committer.staging.tmp.path	fs.azure.secure.mode	ipc.client.tcpnodelay	ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds	file.blocksize	fs.adl.oauth2.msi.port
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.user.agent.prefix: The 'fs.azure.user.agent.prefix' property might not be correctly set as 'unknown'. It is recommended to provide a meaningful value to identify the application or service.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.AbstractFileSystem.ftp.impl: The 'fs.AbstractFileSystem.ftp.impl' property is correct but ensure that the FTP FileSystem is required for your deployment as it's less common.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.committer.staging.tmp.path: The 'fs.s3a.committer.staging.tmp.path' should be checked for correctness. Ensure that 'tmp/staging' is the intended path for temporary data.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.azure.secure.mode: The 'fs.azure.secure.mode' is set to true, which is recommended for secure operations. However, ensure that your environment is configured to use SAS keys.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.tcpnodelay: The 'ipc.client.tcpnodelay' is set to false by default, which might not be optimal for all environments. Consider enabling TCP_NODELAY if your application is latency-sensitive.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds: The 'ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.thresholds' property uses a placeholder '[port_number]' which should be replaced with the actual port number intended for configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for file.blocksize: The 'file.blocksize' is set to a specific value, ensure this aligns with your HDFS or file system requirements.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.adl.oauth2.msi.port: The 'fs.adl.oauth2.msi.port' is set to 3000, ensure this is the correct port for the MSI token service in your environment.
