Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['fs.permissions.umask-mode', 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms'], 'reason': ["The property 'fs.permissions.umask-mode' has the value '999' which is not a valid umask value. Valid umask values are in the range from '000' to '777'.", "The property 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' has the value '1' which might be too low for practical use, potentially leading to frequent timeouts. While technically not incorrect, it is recommended to use a higher value for network stability."]}

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['fs.permissions.umask-mode', 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms'], 'reason': ["The property 'fs.permissions.umask-mode' has the value '999' which is not a valid umask value.", "The property 'ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms' has the value '1' which is too low, potentially leading to premature timeouts."]}
