Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: io.compression.codec.bzip2.library	fs.s3a.select.input.csv.comment.marker	net.topology.table.file.name	hadoop.http.authentication.type	dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout	hadoop.registry.zk.session.timeout.ms	seq.io.sort.mb
[Ciri] Reason for io.compression.codec.bzip2.library: The value of "system-native" indicates that the default system library should be used.  To indicate that the algorithm should operate entirely in Java, specify "java-builtin".
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.select.input.csv.comment.marker: In S3 Select queries: the marker for comment lines in CSV files
[Ciri] Reason for net.topology.table.file.name: The file name for a topology file, which is used when the net.topology.node.switch.mapping.impl property is set to org.apache.hadoop.net.TableMapping. The file format is a two column text file, with columns separated by whitespace. The first column is a DNS or IP address and the second column specifies the rack where the address maps. If no entry corresponding to a host in the cluster is found, then /default-rack is assumed.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.http.authentication.type: Defines authentication used for Oozie HTTP endpoint. Supported values are: simple | kerberos | #AUTHENTICATION_HANDLER_CLASSNAME#
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout: SSH connection timeout, in milliseconds, to use with the builtin sshfence fencer.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.registry.zk.session.timeout.ms: Zookeeper session timeout in milliseconds
[Ciri] Reason for seq.io.sort.mb: The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files, while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks.
