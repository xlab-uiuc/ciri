Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['io.file.buffer.size', 'io.bytes.per.checksum', 'fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age', 'ipc.client.idlethreshold', 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockfree'], 'reason': ["The property 'io.file.buffer.size' has an additional 'usage' tag which is not a valid property element.", "The property 'io.bytes.per.checksum' has an additional 'usage' tag which is not a valid property element.", "The property 'fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element.", "The property 'ipc.client.idlethreshold' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element.", "The property 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockfree' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element."]}

Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: io.file.buffer.size	io.bytes.per.checksum	fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age	ipc.client.idlethreshold	ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockfree
[Ciri] Reason for io.file.buffer.size: The property 'io.file.buffer.size' has an additional 'usage' tag which is not a valid property element.
[Ciri] Reason for io.bytes.per.checksum: The property 'io.bytes.per.checksum' has an additional 'usage' tag which is not a valid property element.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age: The property 'fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.client.idlethreshold: The property 'ipc.client.idlethreshold' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockfree: The property 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockfree' is missing a 'usage' tag which is a required property element.
