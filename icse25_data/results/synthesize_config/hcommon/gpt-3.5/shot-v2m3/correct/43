{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['fs.s3a.change.detection.mode', 'ha.zookeeper.parent-znode'], 'reason': ["The property 'fs.s3a.change.detection.mode' has the value 'server' which may not work with third-party S3 implementations that do not support these constraints on GetObject.", "The property 'ha.zookeeper.parent-znode' has the value '/valid/file1' which does not follow the correct path format."]}

Final result:
