Final result:

There are 6 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.ftp.data.connection.mode	fs.AbstractFileSystem.wasbs.impl	ftp.replication	s3.replication	ha.zookeeper.parent-znode	hadoop.ssl.server.conf
[Ciri] Reason for fs.ftp.data.connection.mode: The property 'fs.ftp.data.connection.mode' has an additional usage tag that is not standard in the configuration file.
[Ciri] Reason for fs.AbstractFileSystem.wasbs.impl: The property 'fs.AbstractFileSystem.wasbs.impl' has an additional usage tag that may not be valid in the configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for ftp.replication: The property 'ftp.replication' should have a more descriptive name or a different context to avoid confusion with HDFS replication.
[Ciri] Reason for s3.replication: The property 's3.replication' should have a more descriptive name or a different context to avoid confusion with HDFS replication.
[Ciri] Reason for ha.zookeeper.parent-znode: The property 'ha.zookeeper.parent-znode' has an additional usage tag that may not be valid in the configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for hadoop.ssl.server.conf: The property 'hadoop.ssl.server.conf' should have a more descriptive name or purpose.
