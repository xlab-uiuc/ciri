Wrong shot number:
[13, 2]

Correct shot number:
[8, 1, 4]

Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['fs.du.interval', 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response'], 'reason': ["The property 'fs.du.interval' has the value '1200000' which is too large for a refresh interval.", "The property 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response' has the value '0' which may not provide accurate timing for the RESPONSE phase."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: fs.du.interval	ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response
[Ciri] Reason for fs.du.interval: The property 'fs.du.interval' has the value '1200000' which is too large for a refresh interval.
[Ciri] Reason for ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response: The property 'ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response' has the value '0' which may not provide accurate timing for the RESPONSE phase.
