Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['alluxio.worker.network.max.inbound.message.size', 'alluxio.worker.management.tier.promote.range', 'alluxio.network.connection.shutdown.timeout', 'alluxio.master.journal.retry.interval'], 'reason': ["The property 'alluxio.worker.network.max.inbound.message.size' should be specified in bytes, and typically it's represented as an integer followed by the unit, e.g., '8MB' should be '8MB' but ensure it's supported as a valid format or consider using bytes directly.", "The property 'alluxio.worker.management.tier.promote.range' is likely incorrect or misconfigured.

Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: alluxio.worker.network.max.inbound.message.size	alluxio.worker.management.tier.promote.range	alluxio.network.connection.shutdown.timeout	alluxio.master.journal.retry.interval
[Ciri] Reason for alluxio.worker.network.max.inbound.message.size: The property 'alluxio.worker.network.max.inbound.message.size' should be specified in bytes, and typically it's represented as an integer followed by the unit, e.g., '8MB' should be '8MB' but ensure it's supported as a valid format or consider using bytes directly.
[Ciri] Reason for alluxio.worker.management.tier.promote.range: The property 'alluxio.worker.management.tier.promote.range' is likely incorrect or misconfigured. The correct property might be related to tiered storage management but needs to be verified for existence and correct usage in Alluxio 2.5.0.
[Ciri] Reason for alluxio.network.connection.shutdown.timeout: The format for 'alluxio.network.connection.shutdown.timeout' and 'alluxio.master.journal.retry.interval' should be in milliseconds as a long value, e.g., '1sec' should be correctly formatted according to the expected time unit, typically milliseconds (ms).
[Ciri] Reason for alluxio.master.journal.retry.interval: Ensure the time units are correctly specified according to the Alluxio documentation for properties that require time values. '1sec' might need to be converted to a proper format, like '1000ms' if milliseconds are expected.
