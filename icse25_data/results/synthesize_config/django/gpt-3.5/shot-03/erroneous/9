Wrong shot number:
[5, 3, 4]

Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['LOGIN_URL', 'MIDDLEWARE'], 'reason': ["The property 'LOGIN_URL' should be a valid URL but it has the value 'ciri' which is not a valid URL.", "The property 'MIDDLEWARE' should be a list of middleware classes but it is currently empty."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: LOGIN_URL	MIDDLEWARE
[Ciri] Reason for LOGIN_URL: The property 'LOGIN_URL' should be a valid URL but it has the value 'ciri' which is not a valid URL.
[Ciri] Reason for MIDDLEWARE: The property 'MIDDLEWARE' should be a list of middleware classes but it is currently empty.
