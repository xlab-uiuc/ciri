Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK', 'PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT', 'YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT'], 'reason': ["FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK is not a Django setting. The correct setting for the first day of the week is determined within templates using the 'first_day_of_week' tag or by setting LANGUAGE_CODE to match the desired locale.", "PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT setting's value should be in seconds. Since Django 3.1, the default unit is seconds, not days. The provided value calculates to 3 days in seconds, which might be intended, but the description could be misleading.", "YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT is a valid Django setting but the format string 'F Y' might not produce the expected result. Django uses the strftime format, where '%B %Y' is the correct format for full month name followed by year."]}
