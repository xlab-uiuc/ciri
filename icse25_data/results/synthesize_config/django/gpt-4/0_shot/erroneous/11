Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['NUMBER_GROUPING', 'ALLOWED_HOSTS', 'CSRF_COOKIE_AGE'], 'reason': ['NUMBER_GROUPING should typically be a positive integer. A value of -100 is likely incorrect.', 'ALLOWED_HOSTS being empty is a security risk in production. It should include the domain names/IP addresses that the Django site can serve.', "CSRF_COOKIE_AGE is set to a very high value, which is not necessarily an error, but it's unusually long for a CSRF token's lifespan."]}
