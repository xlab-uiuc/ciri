Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['CSRF_COOKIE_PATH', 'EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE'], 'reason': ["CSRF_COOKIE_PATH should be set to a path that is intended for the CSRF cookie. The value 'tmp////staging' seems incorrect as it typically should be a simple path like '/' for the root of the domain.", 'EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE is set to None, which is not necessarily an error but could lead to issues if SSL/TLS is required for sending emails and a certificate file is needed. If not using SSL/TLS for emails, this can be ignored.']}
