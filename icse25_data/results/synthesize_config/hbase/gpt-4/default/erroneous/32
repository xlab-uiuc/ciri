Wrong shot number:
[10, 2, 12]

Correct shot number:
[1]

Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress', 'hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio', 'hbase.offpeak.end.hour'], 'reason': ["The value '999.-1.0.0' for 'hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress' is not a valid IP address.", "The value '-1' for 'hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio' is out of the valid range. It should be between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.", "The value '0' for 'hbase.offpeak.end.hour' is valid but may not be intended as it sets the end of off-peak hours to midnight, effectively not defining an off-peak period if 'hbase.offpeak.start.hour' is not set to '0' as well."]}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress	hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio	hbase.offpeak.end.hour
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress: The value '999.-1.0.0' for 'hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress' is not a valid IP address.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio: The value '-1' for 'hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio' is out of the valid range. It should be between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.offpeak.end.hour: The value '0' for 'hbase.offpeak.end.hour' is valid but may not be intended as it sets the end of off-peak hours to midnight, effectively not defining an off-peak period if 'hbase.offpeak.start.hour' is not set to '0' as well.
