Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size	hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks	hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size	hbase.hstore.compaction.max.size
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size: The default value for 'hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size' is incorrectly stated as 0.5. The correct default should be 0.4 as per the description.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks: The value for 'hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks' is set to 150, which might be a misunderstanding. This setting controls the maximum number of concurrent mutation tasks to a single region, and setting it too high could lead to performance issues. The typical default or recommended values are much lower.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size: The usage example for 'hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size' suggests setting it to 10MB (1024 * 1024 * 10), which contradicts the actual value set in the property (67108864, which is 64MB). This inconsistency could lead to confusion.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hstore.compaction.max.size: The value for 'hbase.hstore.compaction.max.size' is set to 18446744073709551614, which is just 2 bytes less than the maximum value for a long in Java. This might be an attempt to effectively disable compaction by setting the value extremely high, but it could lead to misunderstanding or misconfiguration, as the description suggests using the default value of LONG.MAX_VALUE for this purpose.
