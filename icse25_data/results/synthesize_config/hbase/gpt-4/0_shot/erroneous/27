Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.regionserver.region.split.policy	hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit	hbase.server.versionfile.writeattempts	hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound.min	hbase.hregion.majorcompaction	hbase.mob.compaction.batch.size	hbase.mob.compaction.chore.period
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.region.split.policy: The value 'NONE_POLICY' for 'hbase.regionserver.region.split.policy' does not match any known split policy. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrect value.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit: The default value for 'hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit' is mentioned as 1000, but it is not clear if 2000 is an intentional override or a mistake.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.server.versionfile.writeattempts: The property 'hbase.server.versionfile.writeattempts' and its description do not indicate if the value 6 is a default or an adjusted value. Without context, it's unclear if this is an error.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound.min: The value for 'hbase.hregion.percolumnfamilyflush.size.lower.bound.min' is very specific, and without context, it's hard to determine if 33554432 is correct or an error.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hregion.majorcompaction: The 'hbase.hregion.majorcompaction' value is set to 1209600000 ms (14 days), which contradicts the description stating the default is 7 days. This might be an intentional adjustment or a mistake.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.mob.compaction.batch.size: The 'hbase.mob.compaction.batch.size' default value is stated as 100, but it's set to 200 here. It's unclear if this is an intentional change or an oversight.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.mob.compaction.chore.period: The 'hbase.mob.compaction.chore.period' is set to 1209600 seconds (14 days), which contradicts the description that mentions a default of one week. This could be an intentional change or a mistake.
