Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl	hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit	hbase.zookeeper.peerport	hbase.normalizer.period	hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size	hbase.master.normalizer.class	hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period	hbase.mob.compaction.threads.max
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl: The usage example for 'hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl' is incorrect. The correct usage should not include HTU.getConfiguration(). It should be directly set on the Configuration object.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit: The default value for 'hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit' is mentioned as 1000, but no default value is actually set in the property value.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.zookeeper.peerport: The usage example for 'hbase.zookeeper.peerport' suggests a default value of 2888, which is the typical default for ZooKeeper, but the value provided is 1444 without explanation for the deviation.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.normalizer.period: The usage example for 'hbase.normalizer.period' is incorrect. It should use setInt for setting the value, not getInt for retrieving it.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size: The description for 'hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size' is overly verbose and could potentially confuse users with its detailed explanation about previous versions of HBase.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.normalizer.class: The URL provided in the description of 'hbase.master.normalizer.class' is not directly accessible without navigating through the HBase documentation site.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period: The value for 'hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period' is set to 1, which is impractically frequent and could lead to performance issues.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.mob.compaction.threads.max: The value for 'hbase.mob.compaction.threads.max' is set to 1, which might be too low for environments with a high volume of MOB (Medium Object) data, potentially leading to slow compaction times.
