Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl	hbase.hregion.preclose.flush.size	hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio	hbase.thrift.maxQueuedRequests	hbase.dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size	hbase.hstore.checksum.algorithm	hbase.dynamic.jars.dir
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl: The value for 'hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl' should be in milliseconds, and the example usage suggests setting it to 10, which is likely a mistake since the value is too small to be practical.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hregion.preclose.flush.size: The value for 'hbase.hregion.preclose.flush.size' is set to 2621440, which might not match the recommended or default settings. The usage example suggests a default of 5MB, but the actual value set does not align with this.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio: The 'hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio' description suggests a range of values but does not explicitly state if 2.4 is within a recommended range. The explanation is more about understanding the impact of different values rather than indicating a correct or incorrect setting.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.thrift.maxQueuedRequests: The 'hbase.thrift.maxQueuedRequests' value of 2000 might be too high or too low depending on the deployment size and expected load, but without more context, it's difficult to definitively say it's an error.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size: The 'hbase.dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size' is set to 65536, which is advised to be greater than the default block size. Without knowing the block size setting, it's challenging to confirm if this is an error.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hstore.checksum.algorithm: The 'hbase.hstore.checksum.algorithm' is set to 'CRC32C', which is a valid option. The description does not indicate any preferred or deprecated options, making it unclear if this setting is erroneous.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.dynamic.jars.dir: The 'hbase.dynamic.jars.dir' uses a variable '${hbase.rootdir}/lib' which is a valid approach to setting paths based on other configuration properties. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is incorrect.
