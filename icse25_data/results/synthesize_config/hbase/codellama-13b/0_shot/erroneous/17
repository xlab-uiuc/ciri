Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['hbase.zookeeper.quorum'], 'reason': ['The value of hbase.zookeeper.quorum should be a comma-separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble. For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com". By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full list of ZooKeeper ensemble servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh this is the list of servers which hbase will start/stop ZooKeeper on as part of cluster start/stop. Client-side, we will take this list of ensemble members and put it together with the hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort config. and pass it into zookeeper constructor as the connectString parameter.']}

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['hbase.zookeeper.quorum'], 'reason': ['The value of hbase.zookeeper.quorum should be a comma-separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble, not a single server.']}

{'hasError': False, 'errParameter': [], 'reason': []}

Final result:

There are 1 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.zookeeper.quorum
