Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size	hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold	hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size: The property 'hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size' has an empty default value which may cause issues. It's recommended to provide a valid default value.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold: The property 'hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold' has a very high value which may not be appropriate. It's recommended to adjust it to a reasonable value based on the number of client threads.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle: The value for 'hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle' is too large. It should be a reasonable threshold for compactions.
