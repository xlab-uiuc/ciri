Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: zookeeper.session.timeout	hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks
[Ciri] Reason for zookeeper.session.timeout: The property 'zookeeper.session.timeout' has the value '-1' which is not within the accepted value range for session timeout.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks: The property 'hbase.client.max.perregion.tasks' has the value '0' which is not within the accepted value range.
