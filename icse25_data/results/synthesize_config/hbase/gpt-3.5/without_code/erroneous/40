Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak	hbase.offpeak.end.hour	hbase.status.multicast.address.port
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak: The property 'hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak' has the value '4.0F' which is not a valid float value.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.offpeak.end.hour: The property 'hbase.offpeak.end.hour' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range for off-peak hours.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.status.multicast.address.port: The property 'hbase.status.multicast.address.port' has the value '3000' which is already in use by 'hbase.snapshot.restore.take.failsafe.snapshot'.
