Wrong shot number:
[4, 9, 2]

Correct shot number:
[1]

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort	hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort: The property 'hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort' has the value '1090' which is out of the valid range of a port number.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold: The property 'hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold' has a very high value which may lead to performance issues. It should be set to a more reasonable value.
