Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes', 'hbase.rest.port'], 'reason': ["The property 'hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes' has a value of '1' but the description indicates it should be in milliseconds, so this value is likely too low.", "The property 'hbase.rest.port' has a <usage> tag that references a servlet configuration, but this is an HBase configuration file, not a servlet configuration."]}
