Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.tmp.dir	hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl	hbase.balancer.period	hfile.block.index.cacheonwrite	hbase.status.multicast.address.port	hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period	hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.tmp.dir: The value of hbase.tmp.dir is not a valid path. It should be a path that starts with /.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl: The value of hbase.master.logcleaner.ttl is not a valid number. It should be a number that is greater than 0.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.balancer.period: The value of hbase.balancer.period is not a valid number. It should be a number that is greater than 0.
[Ciri] Reason for hfile.block.index.cacheonwrite: The value of hfile.block.index.cacheonwrite is not a valid boolean. It should be either true or false.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.status.multicast.address.port: The value of hbase.status.multicast.address.port is not a valid port number. It should be a number between 1024 and 65535.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period: The value of hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period is not a valid number. It should be a number that is greater than 0.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold: The value of hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold is not a valid number. It should be a number that is greater than 0.
