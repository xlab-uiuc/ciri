Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.regionserver.info.port	hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress	hbase.regionserver.hlog.writer.impl	hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size	hbase.storescanner.parallel.seek.threads	hbase.replication.rpc.codec	hbase.replication.source.maxthreads	hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.info.port: The port for the HBase RegionServer web UI Set to -1 if you do not want the RegionServer UI to run.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.info.bindAddress: The address for the HBase RegionServer web UI
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.regionserver.hlog.writer.impl: The WAL file writer implementation.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size: Memstore will be flushed to disk if size of the memstore exceeds this number of bytes.  Value is checked by a thread that runs every hbase.server.thread.wakefrequency.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.storescanner.parallel.seek.threads: The default thread pool size if parallel-seeking feature enabled.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.replication.rpc.codec: The codec that is to be used when replication is enabled so that the tags are also replicated. This is used along with HFileV3 which supports tags in them.  If tags are not used or if the hfile version used is HFileV2 then KeyValueCodec can be used as the replication codec. Note that using KeyValueCodecWithTags for replication when there are no tags causes no harm.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.replication.source.maxthreads: The maximum number of threads any replication source will use for shipping edits to the sinks in parallel. This also limits the number of chunks each replication batch is broken into. Larger values can improve the replication throughput between the master and slave clusters. The default of 10 will rarely need to be changed.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.mob.ttl.cleaner.period: The period that ExpiredMobFileCleanerChore runs. The unit is second. The default value is one day. The MOB file name uses only the date part of the file creation time in it. We use this time for deciding TTL expiry of the files. So the removal of TTL expired files might be delayed. The max delay might be 24 hrs.
