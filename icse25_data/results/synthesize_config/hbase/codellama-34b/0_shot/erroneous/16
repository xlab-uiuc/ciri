Final result:

There are 7 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hbase.master.info.port	hbase.zookeeper.leaderport	hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir	hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort	hfile.index.block.max.size	hbase.auth.key.update.interval	hbase.data.umask.enable
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.master.info.port: The port for the HBase Master web UI. Set to -1 if you do not want a UI instance run.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.zookeeper.leaderport: Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg. The port at which the clients will connect.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir: Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg. The directory where the snapshot is stored.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort: When the size of a leaf-level, intermediate-level, or root-level index block in a multi-level block index grows to this size, the block is written out and a new block is started.
[Ciri] Reason for hfile.index.block.max.size: Maximum retries.  This is maximum number of iterations to atomic bulk loads are attempted in the face of splitting operations 0 means never give up.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.auth.key.update.interval: The update interval for master key for authentication tokens in servers in milliseconds.  Only used when HBase security is enabled.
[Ciri] Reason for hbase.data.umask.enable: Enable, if true, that file permissions should be assigned to the files written by the regionserver
