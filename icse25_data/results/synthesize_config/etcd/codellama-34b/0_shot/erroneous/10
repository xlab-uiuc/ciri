Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['initial-cluster-state', 'auto-tls', 'proxy-read-timeout'], 'reason': ["initial-cluster-state must be set to 'existing' when restoring a cluster from a snapshot", 'auto-tls cannot be set to true when restoring a cluster from a snapshot', "proxy-read-timeout must be set to a value greater than 0 when discovery-fallback is set to 'proxy'"]}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: initial-cluster-state	auto-tls	proxy-read-timeout
[Ciri] Reason for initial-cluster-state: initial-cluster-state must be set to 'existing' when restoring a cluster from a snapshot
[Ciri] Reason for auto-tls: auto-tls cannot be set to true when restoring a cluster from a snapshot
[Ciri] Reason for proxy-read-timeout: proxy-read-timeout must be set to a value greater than 0 when discovery-fallback is set to 'proxy'
