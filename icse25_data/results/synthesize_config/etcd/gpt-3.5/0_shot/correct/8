Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: proxy-read-timeout	force-new-cluster	proxy-write-timeout	heartbeat-interval	max-wals
[Ciri] Reason for proxy-read-timeout: proxy-read-timeout should not be set to 0, it should have a positive value
[Ciri] Reason for force-new-cluster: force-new-cluster should not be set to true unless you intend to force the creation of a new cluster
[Ciri] Reason for proxy-write-timeout: proxy-write-timeout value should be less than 2500
[Ciri] Reason for heartbeat-interval: heartbeat-interval should have a value greater than 0
[Ciri] Reason for max-wals: max-wals value should be greater than 10
