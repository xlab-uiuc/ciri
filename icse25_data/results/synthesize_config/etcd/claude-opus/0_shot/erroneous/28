Use 'quota-backend-bytes' instead to limit the total size of WAL files.", "The 'heartbeat-interval' value of 200 is too low. It should be at least 500ms. A too low value can cause unnecessary network and CPU overhead.", "The 'auto-compaction-retention' value of 2 is too low. It should be at least 1 hour (1h).
