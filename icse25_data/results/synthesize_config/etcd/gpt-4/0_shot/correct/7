Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['election-timeout', 'quota-backend-bytes', 'discovery-fallback'], 'reason': ["The 'election-timeout' is usually specified in milliseconds, but the recommended value is at least 10000ms to avoid frequent leader changes.", "Setting 'quota-backend-bytes' to 0 is not recommended. This parameter should be set to a positive number to limit the storage size of the backend database. A value of 0 means no limit, which could potentially lead to issues if the database grows too large.", "The 'discovery-fallback' option is not a recognized configuration parameter in etcd version 3.5.0. This might be a typo or a misunderstanding of the available configuration options."]}
