Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: max_files_per_process	wal_receiver_status_interval	log_startup_progress_interval	stats_fetch_consistency	jit_inline_above_cost
[Ciri] Reason for max_files_per_process: The property 'max_files_per_process' has the value '-1' which is not a valid positive integer.
[Ciri] Reason for wal_receiver_status_interval: The property 'wal_receiver_status_interval' has the value '10s' which is not a valid integer.
[Ciri] Reason for log_startup_progress_interval: The property 'log_startup_progress_interval' has the value '10s' which is not a valid integer.
[Ciri] Reason for stats_fetch_consistency: The property 'stats_fetch_consistency' has the value 'cache' which is not a valid setting.
[Ciri] Reason for jit_inline_above_cost: The property 'jit_inline_above_cost' has the value '500000' which exceeds the range of an Integer.
