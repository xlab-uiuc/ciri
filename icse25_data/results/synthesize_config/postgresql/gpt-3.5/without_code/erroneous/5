Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: shared_buffers	vacuum_multixact_failsafe_age	max_slot_wal_keep_size	autovacuum_naptime
[Ciri] Reason for shared_buffers: The property 'shared_buffers' has the value '128mm' which uses an incorrect unit.
[Ciri] Reason for vacuum_multixact_failsafe_age: The property 'vacuum_multixact_failsafe_age' has the value '3200000000' which exceeds the range of an Integer.
[Ciri] Reason for max_slot_wal_keep_size: The property 'max_slot_wal_keep_size' has the value '-1' which is out of range.
[Ciri] Reason for autovacuum_naptime: The property 'autovacuum_naptime' has the value '10min' which uses an incorrect unit.
