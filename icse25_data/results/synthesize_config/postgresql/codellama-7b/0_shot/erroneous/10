{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['max_connections', 'shared_buffers', 'wal_writer_flush_after'], 'reason': ['max_connections must be an integer', 'shared_buffers must be a valid memory size', 'wal_writer_flush_after must be a valid memory size']}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: max_connections	shared_buffers	wal_writer_flush_after
[Ciri] Reason for max_connections: max_connections must be greater than 0
[Ciri] Reason for shared_buffers: shared_buffers must be a valid memory size
[Ciri] Reason for wal_writer_flush_after: wal_writer_flush_after must be a valid memory size
