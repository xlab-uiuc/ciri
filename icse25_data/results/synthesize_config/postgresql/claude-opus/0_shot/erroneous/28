Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['old_snapshot_threshold', 'min_wal_size'], 'reason': ["The 'old_snapshot_threshold' parameter has been removed in PostgreSQL 13. It was used in earlier versions to set the minimum time that a snapshot could be used for. This is now automatically managed by the system.", "The default value for 'min_wal_size' in PostgreSQL 13 is 80MB. Setting it to 160MB is valid but you should ensure you have a reason for increasing this as it will impact the amount of disk space used by WAL files."]}

Final result:
