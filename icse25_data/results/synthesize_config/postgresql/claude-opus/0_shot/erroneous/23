Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['tcp_keepalives_interval', 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit'], 'reason': ["The 'tcp_keepalives_interval' parameter is not valid in PostgreSQL 13. It was removed in version 12. Use the 'tcp_keepalives_time' parameter instead.", "Setting 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' to 0 is not recommended as it may cause autovacuum to be too aggressive and impact performance. It's better to tune this value based on your system resources and requirements."]}

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: tcp_keepalives_interval	autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit
