Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['synchronous_standby_names', 'tcp_keepalives_interval', 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit'], 'reason': ["The property 'synchronous_standby_names' has an invalid value. The value should not end with an apostrophe.", "The property 'tcp_keepalives_interval' has the value '0' which is not allowed. The value must be a positive integer or disabled by setting to -1.", "The property 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' has the value '0' which is not allowed. It should be set to a positive integer or -1 to use the default setting."]}
