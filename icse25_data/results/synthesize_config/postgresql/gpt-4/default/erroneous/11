{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['external_pid_file', 'log_startup_progress_interval'], 'reason': ["The value of 'external_pid_file' contains multiple slashes which might be interpreted incorrectly or cause errors.", "The 'log_startup_progress_interval' value of '1s' might be too low, potentially causing excessive logging. However, if this is intentional for debugging purposes, it could be acceptable."]}
