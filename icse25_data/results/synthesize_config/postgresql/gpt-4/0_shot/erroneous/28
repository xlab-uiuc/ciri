Final result:

There are 6 misconfiguration parameters in the input: random_page_cost	syslog_sequence_numbers	old_snapshot_threshold	track_functions	client_encoding	min_wal_size
[Ciri] Reason for random_page_cost: The 'random_page_cost' setting seems unusual. While technically not an error, typical values are much lower, suggesting a possible misconfiguration.
[Ciri] Reason for syslog_sequence_numbers: The 'syslog_sequence_numbers' parameter does not exist in PostgreSQL configuration. It might be a misunderstanding or a typo.
[Ciri] Reason for old_snapshot_threshold: The 'old_snapshot_threshold' value of -1 is not an error per se, but it disables a feature that could be beneficial for certain workloads. It's worth reviewing based on your use case.
[Ciri] Reason for track_functions: The 'track_functions' parameter is valid, but 'none' is its default value, indicating no functions will be tracked. This is not an error, but specifying it explicitly is unnecessary unless changing the value.
[Ciri] Reason for client_encoding: The 'client_encoding' set to 'sql_ascii' might not be an error, but it's often recommended to use UTF-8 for broader character support, unless there's a specific reason for this choice.
[Ciri] Reason for min_wal_size: The 'min_wal_size' is correctly formatted, but the value of 160MB might be too low for most production environments, potentially leading to suboptimal performance under heavy write loads.
