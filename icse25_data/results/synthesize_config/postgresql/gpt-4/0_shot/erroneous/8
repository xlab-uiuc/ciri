Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: bgwriter_delay	enable_async_append	backslash_quote	max_pred_locks_per_relation	log_min_duration_sample
[Ciri] Reason for bgwriter_delay: bgwriter_delay should be in milliseconds (ms), not nanoseconds (NS).
[Ciri] Reason for enable_async_append: enable_async_append is not a recognized configuration parameter in PostgreSQL.
[Ciri] Reason for backslash_quote: backslash_quote is deprecated and should not be used in PostgreSQL 13.0.
[Ciri] Reason for max_pred_locks_per_relation: max_pred_locks_per_relation cannot be negative. -2 is not a valid value.
[Ciri] Reason for log_min_duration_sample: log_min_duration_sample is not a valid configuration parameter. Perhaps it was meant to be log_min_duration_statement.
