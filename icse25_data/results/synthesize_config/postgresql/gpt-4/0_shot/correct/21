Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['max_prepared_transactions', 'effective_io_concurrency'], 'reason': ["Setting 'max_prepared_transactions' to 0 disables prepared transactions which might not be intended. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than zero if using prepared transactions.", "Setting 'effective_io_concurrency' to 0 disables asynchronous I/O which might reduce performance. Consider setting this to a higher value if your storage system supports asynchronous I/O."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: max_prepared_transactions	effective_io_concurrency
[Ciri] Reason for max_prepared_transactions: Setting 'max_prepared_transactions' to 0 disables prepared transactions which might not be intended. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than zero if using prepared transactions.
[Ciri] Reason for effective_io_concurrency: Setting 'effective_io_concurrency' to 0 disables asynchronous I/O which might reduce performance. Consider setting this to a higher value if your storage system supports asynchronous I/O.
