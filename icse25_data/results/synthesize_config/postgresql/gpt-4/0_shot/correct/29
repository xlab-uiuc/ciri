Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['geqo_seed', 'unix_socket_permissions'], 'reason': ["The 'geqo_seed' parameter should be a floating point number between 0 and 1, inclusive. The provided value of 1.0 is technically valid, but specifying it as '1.0' might imply misunderstanding, as it typically should be within the range but not at the extreme ends.", "The 'unix_socket_permissions' parameter should be specified in octal format. The correct format for permissions would typically start with a '0' (e.g., 0388 instead of 388) to ensure it is interpreted correctly as an octal value."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: geqo_seed	unix_socket_permissions
[Ciri] Reason for geqo_seed: The 'geqo_seed' parameter should be a floating point number between 0 and 1, inclusive. The provided value of 1.0 is technically valid, but specifying it as '1.0' might imply misunderstanding, as it typically should be within the range but not at the extreme ends.
[Ciri] Reason for unix_socket_permissions: The 'unix_socket_permissions' parameter should be specified in octal format. The correct format for permissions would typically start with a '0' (e.g., 0388 instead of 388) to ensure it is interpreted correctly as an octal value.
