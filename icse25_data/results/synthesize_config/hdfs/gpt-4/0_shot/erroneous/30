Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.client.cached.conn.retry	dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication	dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period	dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.cached.conn.retry: The value for 'dfs.client.cached.conn.retry' should not be negative. It defines the number of retry attempts for pulling a socket from the cache.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication: The value for 'dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication' should not be negative. It specifies the minimum replication necessary to continue writing, not to disable the feature.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period: The value for 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' should not include a unit ('s' for seconds) directly. It should be an integer representing seconds.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms: The value for 'dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms' seems too low. While technically not incorrect, practical values are usually in the range of thousands (e.g., 3000ms) to ensure the operation can complete.
