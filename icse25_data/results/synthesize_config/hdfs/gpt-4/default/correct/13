Wrong shot number:
[7, 12, 15]

Correct shot number:
[4]

Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec', 'dfs.mover.moverThreads'], 'reason': ["The value '100m' for property 'dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec' is not in the correct format. It should be in bytes per second without a suffix.", "The value '1000' for property 'dfs.mover.moverThreads' seems excessively high and could lead to resource contention."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec	dfs.mover.moverThreads
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec: The value '100m' for property 'dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec' is not in the correct format. It should be in bytes per second without a suffix.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.mover.moverThreads: The value '1000' for property 'dfs.mover.moverThreads' seems excessively high and could lead to resource contention.
