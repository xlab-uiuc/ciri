{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['dfs.replication.max', 'dfs.namenode.max.objects', 'dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout'], 'reason': ["The property 'dfs.replication.max' has a value of 1024 which seems unusually high for block replication. Please verify if this value is intended.", "The property 'dfs.namenode.max.objects' has a value of 0 which indicates no limit to the number of objects supported by HDFS. Please ensure this is the desired configuration.", "The property 'dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout' has a value of 1s which might be too short for a datanode restart timeout.

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.replication.max	dfs.namenode.max.objects	dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.replication.max: Property 'dfs.replication.max' should have a value less than or equal to the maximum replication factor.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.max.objects: The property 'dfs.namenode.max.objects' has a value of 0 which indicates no limit to the number of objects supported by HDFS. Please ensure this is the desired configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout: Property 'dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout' should have a value greater than zero.
