There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.client.cached.conn.retry	dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.cached.conn.retry: The property 'dfs.client.cached.conn.retry' has the value '-1' which is not within the accepted value {0,1,2,3,4,5}.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication: The property 'dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication' has the value '-1' which is not within the accepted value {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.
