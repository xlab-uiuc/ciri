Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.namenode.replication.min	dfs.datanode.fileio.profiling.sampling.percentage	dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.replication.min: The property 'dfs.namenode.replication.min' has the value '0' which should be greater than 0 for minimal block replication.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.datanode.fileio.profiling.sampling.percentage: The property 'dfs.datanode.fileio.profiling.sampling.percentage' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range of 1 to 100 for enabling disk statistics.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout: The property 'dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout' has the value '0' which should be greater than 0 to set a maximum amount of time for a block to move.
