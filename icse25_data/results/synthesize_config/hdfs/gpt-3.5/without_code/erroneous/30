Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.client.cached.conn.retry	dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication	dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period	dfs.domain.socket.path	dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.cached.conn.retry: The property 'dfs.client.cached.conn.retry' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range for connection retries.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication: The property 'dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication' has the value '-1' which is out of the valid range for minimum replications.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period: The property 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' has the value '3600s' which should not contain time unit suffix.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.domain.socket.path: The property 'dfs.domain.socket.path' has the value '/valid/file2' which does not follow the correct path format.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms: The property 'dfs.namenode.storageinfo.defragment.timeout.ms' has the value '8' which is not in the correct format for timeout values.
