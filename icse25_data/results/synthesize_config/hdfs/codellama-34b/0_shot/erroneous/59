Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.datanode.http.address	dfs.block.access.token.lifetime	dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec	dfs.namenode.max.objects	dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval	dfs.ha.zkfc.port	dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.errors	dfs.namenode.send.qop.enabled
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.datanode.http.address: The datanode http server address and port.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.block.access.token.lifetime: The lifetime of access tokens in minutes.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec: Determines block reporting interval in milliseconds.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.max.objects: The maximum number of files, directories and blocks dfs supports.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval: Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as "stale", i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated as "stale" by default.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.ha.zkfc.port: The port number that the zookeeper failover controller RPC server binds to.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.errors: During a block move from a source to destination disk, we might encounter various errors. This defines how many errors we can tolerate before we declare a move between 2 disks (or a step) has failed.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.send.qop.enabled: A boolean specifies whether NameNode should encrypt the established QOP and include it in block token. The encrypted QOP will be used by DataNode as target QOP, overwriting DataNode configuration. This ensures DataNode will use exactly the same QOP NameNode and client has already agreed on.
