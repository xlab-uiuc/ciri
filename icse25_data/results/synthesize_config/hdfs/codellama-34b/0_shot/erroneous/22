Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address	dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration	nfs.mountd.port	dfs.datanode.outliers.report.interval	dfs.client.mmap.enabled	dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms	dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps	httpfs.buffer.size
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address: The value of this property will take the form of nn-host1:rpc-port. If the value of this property is unset the value of dfs.namenode.rpc-address will be used as the default.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration: Value should be a positive, non-zero percentage in float notation (X.Yf), with 1.0f meaning 100%.
[Ciri] Reason for nfs.mountd.port: Specify the port number used by Hadoop mount daemon.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.datanode.outliers.report.interval: This setting controls how frequently DataNodes will report their peer latencies to the NameNode via heartbeats. This setting supports multiple time unit suffixes as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval. If no suffix is specified then milliseconds is assumed.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.client.mmap.enabled: If this is set to false, the client won't attempt to perform memory-mapped reads.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms: How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache.
[Ciri] Reason for dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps: The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling. This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer, Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier.
[Ciri] Reason for httpfs.buffer.size: The size buffer to be used when creating or opening httpfs filesystem IO stream.
