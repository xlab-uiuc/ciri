Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['slowlog-max-len', 'latency-monitor-threshold', 'hll-sparse-max-bytes', 'tcp-backlog'], 'reason': ['slowlog-max-len must be greater than 0', 'latency-monitor-threshold must be greater than 0', 'hll-sparse-max-bytes must be greater than 0', 'tcp-backlog must be greater than 0']}

Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: slowlog-max-len	latency-monitor-threshold	hll-sparse-max-bytes	tcp-backlog
[Ciri] Reason for slowlog-max-len: slowlog-max-len must be greater than 0
[Ciri] Reason for latency-monitor-threshold: latency-monitor-threshold must be greater than 0
[Ciri] Reason for hll-sparse-max-bytes: hll-sparse-max-bytes must be greater than 0
[Ciri] Reason for tcp-backlog: tcp-backlog must be greater than 0
