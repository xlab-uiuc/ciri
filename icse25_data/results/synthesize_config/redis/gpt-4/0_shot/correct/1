Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: cluster-announce-ip	replica-announce-ip
[Ciri] Reason for cluster-announce-ip: Using the loopback address (127.0.0.1) for 'cluster-announce-ip' and 'replica-announce-ip' is typically incorrect for a cluster setup, as it refers to 'localhost' and will not allow other nodes to communicate with this one.
[Ciri] Reason for replica-announce-ip: If this configuration is intended for a single-node setup for testing or development on the same machine, it might be acceptable. However, for a production environment or any setup involving multiple nodes, these should be set to an IP address that is reachable by other nodes.
