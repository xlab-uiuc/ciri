Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['loglevel', 'proto-max-bulk-len', 'aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync'], 'reason': ["The 'loglevel' value 'notice' is valid, but it's not an error in the configuration. This response was mistaken in identifying it as an error.", "The 'proto-max-bulk-len' value should be in bytes, and while '512mb' is an attempt to specify megabytes, Redis configuration does not inherently understand 'mb' as a unit. The value should be specified in bytes.", "The 'aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync' option is correctly specified as 'yes', which is a valid configuration for enabling incremental fsync for AOF rewrites. This was incorrectly identified as an error."]}

Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: loglevel	proto-max-bulk-len	aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync
[Ciri] Reason for loglevel: The 'loglevel' value 'notice' is valid, but it's not an error in the configuration. This response was mistaken in identifying it as an error.
[Ciri] Reason for proto-max-bulk-len: The 'proto-max-bulk-len' value should be in bytes, and while '512mb' is an attempt to specify megabytes, Redis configuration does not inherently understand 'mb' as a unit. The value should be specified in bytes.
[Ciri] Reason for aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync: The 'aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync' option is correctly specified as 'yes', which is a valid configuration for enabling incremental fsync for AOF rewrites. This was incorrectly identified as an error.
