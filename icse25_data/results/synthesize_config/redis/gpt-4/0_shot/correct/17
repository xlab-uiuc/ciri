Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['list-max-listpack-size', 'unixsocketperm'], 'reason': ["'list-max-listpack-size' is not a valid configuration directive. It seems to be a mix of 'list-max-ziplist-size' and 'hash-max-listpack-size', which are valid directives in older versions of Redis. For Redis 7.0.0, the correct directives would be related to data type specific configurations like 'hash-max-ziplist-entries', 'list-max-ziplist-size', etc.", "'unixsocketperm' should be set to a valid octal value representing file system permissions. The value '350' is not a valid octal because octal values can only contain digits 0-7. A correct value might look like '0750' or '0700'."]}

Final result:
