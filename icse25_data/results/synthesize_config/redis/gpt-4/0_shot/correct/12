Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['hash-max-listpack-entries', 'tls-ca-cert-file'], 'reason': ["The correct configuration for setting the maximum number of entries in a hash encoded as a listpack is 'hash-max-ziplist-entries' for Redis versions prior to 7.0. However, starting from Redis 7.0, the configuration directive has been renamed to 'hash-max-listpack-entries'. This parameter itself is not incorrect, but its presence suggests a misunderstanding. Redis 7.0 does indeed use 'hash-max-listpack-entries', but the provided configuration does not seem to have any inherent mistake related to Redis 7.0 compatibility.", "The 'tls-ca-cert-file' option specifies the path to the SSL/TLS CA certificate file. This option is correctly formatted but ensuring the file path is correct and accessible by Redis is crucial for TLS to function properly. There's no mistake in the configuration syntax itself; however, the actual implementation requires that the specified file exists and is correctly placed."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: hash-max-listpack-entries	tls-ca-cert-file
[Ciri] Reason for hash-max-listpack-entries: The correct configuration for setting the maximum number of entries in a hash encoded as a listpack is 'hash-max-ziplist-entries' for Redis versions prior to 7.0. However, starting from Redis 7.0, the configuration directive has been renamed to 'hash-max-listpack-entries'. This parameter itself is not incorrect, but its presence suggests a misunderstanding. Redis 7.0 does indeed use 'hash-max-listpack-entries', but the provided configuration does not seem to have any inherent mistake related to Redis 7.0 compatibility.
[Ciri] Reason for tls-ca-cert-file: The 'tls-ca-cert-file' option specifies the path to the SSL/TLS CA certificate file. This option is correctly formatted but ensuring the file path is correct and accessible by Redis is crucial for TLS to function properly. There's no mistake in the configuration syntax itself; however, the actual implementation requires that the specified file exists and is correctly placed.
