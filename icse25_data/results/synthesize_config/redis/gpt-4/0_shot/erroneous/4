The minimum allowed value is 300 (bytes).", "The 'cluster-announce-port' value of 1 is not valid for normal operations.

Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: replica-priority	unixsocketperm	hll-sparse-max-bytes	cluster-announce-port
[Ciri] Reason for replica-priority: The correct parameter name is 'replica-priority', but it should be followed by an integer value.
[Ciri] Reason for unixsocketperm: The 'unixsocketperm' value should be in octal format, or a valid permission format such as 0750.
[Ciri] Reason for hll-sparse-max-bytes: 'hll-sparse-max-bytes' value is too low. The minimum allowed value is 300 (bytes).
[Ciri] Reason for cluster-announce-port: The 'cluster-announce-port' value of 1 is not valid for normal operations. It should be set to the port number that this node will announce to other cluster nodes, or 0 if the node should announce the port it is currently bound to.
