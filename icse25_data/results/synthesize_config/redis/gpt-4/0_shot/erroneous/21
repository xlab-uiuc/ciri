Final result:

There are 8 misconfiguration parameters in the input: zset-max-listpack-entries	unixsocketperm	hash-max-listpack-entries	auto-aof-rewrite-min-size	latency-monitor-threshold	lazyfree-lazy-eviction	lazyfree-lazy-user-flush	tls-ca-cert-dir
[Ciri] Reason for zset-max-listpack-entries: The 'zset-max-listpack-entries' configuration is not a valid configuration directive. The correct directive might be 'zset-max-ziplist-entries' for older versions, but Redis 7.0 uses a different data structure.
[Ciri] Reason for unixsocketperm: The 'unixsocketperm' value should be in octal format, not decimal. It should likely be '0700' instead of '1400' to set the correct file permissions.
[Ciri] Reason for hash-max-listpack-entries: The 'hash-max-listpack-entries' configuration is valid, but ensure it's the intended setting for your use case.
[Ciri] Reason for auto-aof-rewrite-min-size: The 'auto-aof-rewrite-min-size' value is correctly formatted but verify that 64MB is the desired threshold for your environment.
[Ciri] Reason for latency-monitor-threshold: The 'latency-monitor-threshold' setting is valid. Ensure '1' is the intended value for your use case.
[Ciri] Reason for lazyfree-lazy-eviction: The 'lazyfree-lazy-eviction' option is valid. Make sure 'no' aligns with your desired behavior.
[Ciri] Reason for lazyfree-lazy-user-flush: The 'lazyfree-lazy-user-flush' option is also valid. Confirm 'no' is the intended setting.
[Ciri] Reason for tls-ca-cert-dir: The 'tls-ca-cert-dir' path is a valid configuration. Ensure the directory '/folder1/certs' exists and is accessible by Redis.
