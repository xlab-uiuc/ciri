Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['timeout', 'hash-max-listpack-value'], 'reason': ["'timeout' is not a valid configuration directive. Perhaps 'timeout' was meant to be 'io-threads-do-reads', 'lazyfree-lazy-eviction', or another directive.", "'hash-max-listpack-value' is not a valid configuration directive. It seems to be a mix-up or misunderstanding. The correct directive might be 'hash-max-ziplist-value' or 'hash-max-ziplist-entries' for controlling hash data structure representations."]}
