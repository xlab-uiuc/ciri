Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: daemonize	replica-announce-ip	lazyfree-lazy-server-del	hash-max-listpack-value	stream-node-max-entries
[Ciri] Reason for daemonize: The 'daemonize' option is not a valid configuration directive. Redis is daemonized using the 'redis-server --daemonize yes' command.
[Ciri] Reason for replica-announce-ip: The 'replica-announce-ip' value should not be set to '127.0.0.1' for most configurations, as this IP address is typically used for loopback interfaces. This setting might be incorrect depending on the network configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for lazyfree-lazy-server-del: The 'lazyfree-lazy-server-del' option is not a recognized configuration directive in Redis.
[Ciri] Reason for hash-max-listpack-value: The 'hash-max-listpack-value' is not a valid configuration directive. The correct directive might be 'hash-max-ziplist-value' or 'hash-max-ziplist-entries', depending on the intended configuration.
[Ciri] Reason for stream-node-max-entries: The 'stream-node-max-entries' option is correctly named, but the value might need adjustment based on the use case. The default value is typically higher, suggesting a potential misconfiguration unless specifically required for the use case.
