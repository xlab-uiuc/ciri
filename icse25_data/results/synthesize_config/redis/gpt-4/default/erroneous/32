Raw json:

{'hasError': True, 'errParameter': ['bind-source-addr', 'appenddirname'], 'reason': ["The property 'bind-source-addr' does not exist in Redis configuration. Perhaps 'bind' was intended.", "The property 'appenddirname' does not exist. Perhaps 'dir' was intended for specifying the directory where Redis will store persistence files."]}

Final result:

There are 2 misconfiguration parameters in the input: bind-source-addr	appenddirname
[Ciri] Reason for bind-source-addr: The property 'bind-source-addr' does not exist in Redis configuration. Perhaps 'bind' was intended.
[Ciri] Reason for appenddirname: The property 'appenddirname' does not exist. Perhaps 'dir' was intended for specifying the directory where Redis will store persistence files.
