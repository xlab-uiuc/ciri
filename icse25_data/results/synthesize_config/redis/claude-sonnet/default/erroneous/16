Final result:

There are 3 misconfiguration parameters in the input: cluster-announce-tls-port	maxmemory-clients	tls-protocols
[Ciri] Reason for cluster-announce-tls-port: The property 'cluster-announce-tls-port' has the value '1.1' which is not of the correct type Integer.
[Ciri] Reason for maxmemory-clients: The property 'maxmemory-clients' has the value '1g' which is not a valid value for the maxmemory setting. It should be a number followed by 'kb', 'mb' or 'gb'.
[Ciri] Reason for tls-protocols: The property 'tls-protocols' has an invalid value format. It should be a space-separated list of protocol names enclosed in double quotes.
