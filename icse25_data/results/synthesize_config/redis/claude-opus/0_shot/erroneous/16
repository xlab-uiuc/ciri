Final result:

There are 5 misconfiguration parameters in the input: cluster-announce-tls-port	maxmemory-clients	timeout	repl-backlog-size	latency-monitor-threshold
[Ciri] Reason for cluster-announce-tls-port: cluster-announce-tls-port expects an integer value, but '1.1' is a float.
[Ciri] Reason for maxmemory-clients: maxmemory-clients expects a memory value in bytes, but '1g' is not a valid byte value.
[Ciri] Reason for timeout: timeout expects an integer value in seconds, but '2' is too low. It should be at least 10 seconds.
[Ciri] Reason for repl-backlog-size: repl-backlog-size expects a memory value in bytes, but '1mb' is not a valid byte value. It should be '1m' instead.
[Ciri] Reason for latency-monitor-threshold: latency-monitor-threshold expects an integer value in milliseconds, but '0' is too low. It should be at least 1.
