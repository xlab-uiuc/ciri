Final result:

There are 4 misconfiguration parameters in the input: cluster-announce-bus-port	zset-max-listpack-entries	tcp-backlog	hll-sparse-max-bytes
[Ciri] Reason for cluster-announce-bus-port: In Redis 7.0, 'cluster-announce-bus-port' is no longer a valid configuration directive. It has been replaced by 'cluster-broadcast-bus-port'.
[Ciri] Reason for zset-max-listpack-entries: In Redis 7.0, 'zset-max-listpack-entries' is no longer a valid configuration directive. It has been replaced by 'zset-max-listpack-size'.
[Ciri] Reason for tcp-backlog: 'tcp-backlog' should be a power of two. The closest valid value is 1024.
[Ciri] Reason for hll-sparse-max-bytes: The maximum value allowed for 'hll-sparse-max-bytes' is 3000, so 3000 is valid. However, in Redis 7.0, the default value has been increased to 3000, so explicitly setting it to 3000 is redundant.
